      <h1>TeXIHI</h1>
      <p>
        Last Sunday, I decided to use real LaTeX for my homework. I spent more
        hours than I would like to admit on it, yet I'm very satisfied with the
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why so long? Why is this title "TeX I hate it"? Why didn't I just use a
        standard template and move on? Because I wanted to have clear
        question-answer separation in the dumbest way possible.
      </p>

      />
      <p>Here's what I remember of the process.</p>

      <h2>Getting to a starting point</h2>
      <p>
        I explained to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, my favorite LLM, what I wanted to do.
        Most of its suggestions didn't work in one way or another: the font
        (Excalifont) carried on past the answer section, or some math symbols
        didn't load, or numbers didn't use the font. However, I got to a
        starting point:
      </p>
      <pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{unicode-math}

\newenvironment{answer}
  {\begingroup
   \setmainfont{Excalifont.ttf}
   \setmathfont{Excalifont.ttf}
   \setmathfont{Excalifont.ttf}[range=it]
  }
  {\endgroup}

\begin{document}

Math before answer: $x + y = z$

\begin{answer}
Math inside answer: $a + b = c$
\end{answer}

Math after answer: $x + y = z$

\end{document}
</pre

      <h2>Asking for help</h2>
      <p>
        The problem with that code is that math following the
        <code>answer</code> block is messed up. I formulated a question that
        included a minimal demo and took to three places:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com">TeX Stack Exchange</a>, a
          community of professional TeXers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://pvq.app">Pvq</a>, an experimental AI-powered forum
        </li>
        <li>Asking Claude many more times</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The TeX community explained how I made numerous errors, including using
        <code>\setmainfont</code> in a group, redundantly importing
        <code>unicode-math</code>, and redundantly declaring a group. The guy
        from TeX also showed how to do it the TeX way. While this helped clean
        up my code, it didn't fix things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pvq more or less failed. The grader was a bit borked and none of the AIs
        were helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when I gave my whole problem statement to Claude, after a bit
        of refining it came up with something that worked. It included some
        unnecessary stuff but the real change was only calling
        <code>\setmathfont</code> <em>once</em> with a wider
        <code>range</code> (<code>{up,it,"0030-"007A,"002B,"00D7}</code>)
      </p>

      <h2>Scaling it up</h2>
      <p>
        While that worked, it didn't scale. It had to reload Excalifont every
        time, making it slow and eventually erroring due to too many fonts being
        loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>unicode-math</code> has a solution for this, <code>version</code>.
        Let's just load the font once with <code>version</code>, switch between
        the versions, and everything will be okay! Right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, <code>version</code> and <code>range</code> don't work
        together. If you use them both at once, only <code>range</code> applies
        (the last <code>\mathfontset</code> applies to all math). You can't just
        drop <code>range</code> instead since it'll make
        <code>unicode-math</code> try to use math Unicode for letters and the
        Greek alphabet, which Excalifont doesn't have.
      </p>

      <h2>Messing around more</h2>
      <p>
        Since I had to find something that scaled, I tried a lot of random stuff
        from there. I even tried one approach without <code>unicode-math</code>.
        But eventually, I figured out that I <em>can</em> drop
        <code>range</code>. I just have to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Set <code>math-style=upright</code> when using
          <code>unicode-math</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Renew <code>\pi</code> and <code>\theta</code> to their non-italic
          Unicode equivalents (since step 1 doesn't fix them for some reason)
        </li>
      </ol>
