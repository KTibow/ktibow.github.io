      <h1>The new Google Slides templates are honestly funny</h1>
      <p>
        This month (November 2024) Google added "Templates" to Google Slides.

        On the surface level, they look very good. But once you open one, you
        see the placeholder text, and you start wondering if it's satire. Here's
        what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Honestly perplexing</strong>: Every time there's a contact
        slide, the email is "no reply". That doesn't really make sense for a
        <em>contact</em> email...
      </p>
      <img src="./screenshot-1.png" />
      <p><strong>Buzzword overload</strong>: This slide from "Sales Pitch"</p>
      <img src="./screenshot-3.png" />
      <p>
        <strong>Confusing</strong>: "Educational games" has a hardcoded winner
      </p>
      <img src="./screenshot-4.png" />
      <p>
        <strong>Surely satire</strong>: "Product overview minimal". Let's go
        over it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          So we start with this company Cymbal. They make water bottles. Would
          you buy a water bottle from a company called Cymbal? I wouldn't but I
          guess some people might.
        </li>
        <li>
          It starts off relatively slow. "This is who we are", "these are our
          target consumers", etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            But then they explain that they're not just any water bottle
            company, they're solving a problem made up of 3 elements. As you can
            see, we know the exact proportion of each element:
          </p>
          <img src="./screenshot-5.png" class="h-48" />
        </li>
        <li>
          So then it explains their offering and how it's been growing, shows
          what it looks like and how it's been growing, and includes some
          testimonials. This is
          <em>mostly</em> normal. Oddly, they feature a 4 star review instead of
          a 5 star one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then - no joke - they have a rewards program. How would a rewards
          program even work here?
        </li>
        <li>
          That's basically it. The rest is just the standard growth plan and
          contact information, including the signature no reply email address.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Accidental?</strong>: "Event faciliation" is supposed to be like
        flipping through a book, but it's out of order
      </p>

      <h2>On a positive note</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Just interesting</strong>: "Class overview" uses vectors for a
        raster font graphic. (The other templates use a lot of vectors too,
        including for icons.)
      </p>
      <img src="./screenshot-2.png" />
      <p>
        <strong>Clever</strong>: "Course overview" uses Noto Emoji for
        monochrome icons.
      </p>
      <img src="./screenshot-6.png" />
      <p>
        All templates use free fonts from Google Fonts. It goes to show that you
        can make something without losing money.
      </p>

      <h2>Other thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Templates are really weird in that they look and work like themes, but
        they're separate from themes. Perhaps Google thought themes had a bad
        rep.
