      <h1>University of British Columbia admissions</h1>
      <p>
        If you're a human seeing this, that's very interesting. This page is
        only for some custom scripts I have running to explain the admissions of
        various universities, since their official website can't be read
        statically.
      </p>
      <h2>General US admission requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Graduation from an academic or college preparation program at a US
          regionally accredited school. Applicants are encouraged, but not
          required, to present a minimum of six academic and non-academic Grade
          12 courses.
        </li>
        <li>
          English (composition/literature) to the senior level. ESL English
          courses are not acceptable to satisfy English requirements for
          admission.
        </li>
        <li>Three years of mathematics to the junior level.</li>
        <li>
          A minimum grade of B- in an English course to at least the junior
          level.
        </li>
        <li>
          SAT or ACT. Applicants who have an SAT or ACT test score and would
          like them to be considered as part of the UBC admissions process are
          welcome to submit their test scores. Applicants who choose not to
          submit a standardized test score will not be disadvantaged. (UBC's SAT
          institution code is 0965 and its ACT institution code is 5259.)
        </li>
        <li>
          AP courses completed as part of the high school curriculum may be used
          to meet admission requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>
