      <h1>A stream of thoughts on compression</h1>
      <p>It's a stream about compression. Get it? Compression stream? Ha ha.</p>
      <h2>Zip would be better if compression was cross-file</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my experiments, I've found that ZIP was generally worse than
        other methods, mainly because each file gets its own stream. This means
        that the file name is stored in plain text, and data shared across files
        is treated as separate. This makes it just larger, as demonstrated in
        the FSR breakdown.
      </p>
      <h2>NEU breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        NEU is a large Java Archive, so I've been trying to figure out effective
        ways to reduce its size for a while now. I recently tried making
        tarballs organized by file type and using xz compression - here's what
        that yielded.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Type</td>
          <td>.tar</td>
          <td>.tar.xz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Archives</td>
          <td>12.380 MB</td>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        For context: The original zip was 29.1 MB and the original sum of file
        contents were 37.8 MB.

          >Yes, this means that just using zopflipng and using xz could subtract
          5 MB from the archive. That doesn't mean that's practical, but it's
          interesting to look at.</em

      <h2>FSR breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        FSR is a large texture pack using PNGs and ZIP, and my endeavors have
        shown that the archive format can make as much a difference as the file
        format.
