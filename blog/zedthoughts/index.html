      <h1>What I think of Zed</h1>
      <p>I've had a few phases with Zed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When it first came to Linux, I built it and tried it out</li>
        <li>When it got simpler to download, I tried it out again</li>
        <li>Then it became a working product, and I've been using it since</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's been nice enough to keep using, although it lacks a few features.
        Here's what my experience has been like, grouped by sentiment.
      </p>
      <h2>The good</h2>
      <p>
        Opening and closing Zed is <em>really</em> fast. Editing is fast too,
        and is a little smarter. For example, I don't have to hit F2 to update
        both sides of a XML-like tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zed connects to GitHub Copilot for autocomplete. Plus, Zed, GitHub
        Copilot, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, and any other OpenAI
        compatible server provide AI you can chat with in the sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zed also doesn't get blurry with fractional scaling or require a
        workaround I have to apply every time it updates.
      </p>
      <h2>The soon to come</h2>
      <p>
        A Git/GitHub integration is coming soon. Since I can't be bothered to
        configure Git at a system level, right now, most of Git only works in
        Code. That means I have to open Code just to make a commit and push. The
        Code experience (where you need a bloaty extension to see and edit
        commit history) could definitely be improved on though.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Windows port is also coming soon. I don't use Windows at home, but I
        do at school, and I'd be happy to use Zed there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like Codeium, an AI tool, but it doesn't work in Zed. I'm not sure if
        this is a Zed problem or a Codeium problem, but I hope it gets
        implemented soon. It's definitely faster than GitHub Copilot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typo detection is another field where Zed could improve upon the Code
        experience. In Code, most of the extensions are a bit slow and have
        false positives. Spell checking could be a core feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to view <code>avif</code> files in Zed, you're out of luck
        (for now).
      </p>
      <h2>And the bad</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hotkeys: Zed uses ctrl+alt+o instead of ctrl+r</li>
        <li>
          Hotkeys: With ctrl+tab, Zed defaults to most recently used instead of
          left/right
        </li>
        <li>Svelte: auto imports are sometimes doubled up</li>
        <li>Svelte: quotes are doubled up even in plain text</li>
        <li>
          XML-like: while automatically updating tag names is nice, it can
          sometimes break things
        </li>
      </ul>
