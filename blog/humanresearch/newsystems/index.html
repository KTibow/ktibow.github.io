          Self description: New Systems is an experimental project aimed at
          improving Toronto's systems related to creativity, innovation, and
          culture. The project seeks to form a fundamental understanding of
          needs, then addresses these needs by creating new systems,
          communities, and infrastructure. Learnings and insights from the
          project are shared broadly to benefit the wider community.
