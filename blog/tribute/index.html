      <h1>A Tribute to Home Assistant</h1>
      <p>
        Home Assistant is a wonderful project. It has that ability to make you
        just happy. And in this post I'll talk about my history with it.
      </p>
      <h2>The Start</h2>
      <p class="italic">
        I'm currently a teenager. As such I've grown compared to where I was
        back then, and I'm still growing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I got into Home Assistant is because of a Roomba. Not as in I
        was looking to control it remotely. Instead I had a iRobot Create and I
        was trying to control it remotely. I actually did successfully, with an
        Arduino Yun that had a web server. Anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night I was on the computer, googling about controlling Roombas, and
        found
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2NgA8qYcFI"
          class="text-blue-400"
        >
          this video by The Hook Up</a
        >. It introduced me to Home Assistant, which I set up on an already
        existing Pi. I don't remember that much of where it went from there, but
        I eventually made something that integrated into HA (Fiomba, a script on
        a Pi that connects via MQTT) and set up HA on a separate Pi.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I do remember is the feeling of awe when I first set up Home
        Assistant. I'm not sure why - maybe it was the giant community (HA Core
        has almost 60k stars) or the fact that it integrated stuff you wouldn't
        expect (why is my router broadcasting usage stats?)
      </p>
      <h2>The Setup</h2>
      <p>
        I did a fair bit of talking with the community. I joined the forums
        around Feb 16, 2020. I found a theme I really liked (which is slowly
        dying now):
        <a
          href="https://github.com/qiz-li/lovelace-soft-ui"
          class="text-blue-400"
          >Soft UI</a
        >. I got some really cheap plugs ($5 each) and bulbs ($10 each).
      </p>
      <h2>The Fun</h2>
      <p>
        This spans multiple years because it all blurs together, but I had a lot
        of fun using Home Assistant. I was making themes for it, developing
        other things, participating in the forums. When my parents blocked me
        from using Home Assistant during online school I developed a proxy. I
        had some great summers where all I did was hack on Home Assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        I integrated some random things - a birdcam? a toilet? and lots of other
        things via ESPHome (a great project). I made plenty of dashboards and
        tried to connect plenty of devices.
      </p>
      <h2>The Not-So-Fun</h2>
      <p>
        I've had to reset my HA config multiple times, usually because it was in
        some weird buggy state. I also did some dumb things while contributing
        to the HA frontend. At the time of writing the HA frontend team has
        ghosted me multiple times though - I get that they're busy and my PRs
        are just minor UI things, but it's annoying.
      </p>
      <h2>Today</h2>
      <p>
        A while ago I did another reset, and my HA install is in a good place
        right now. I have a dashboard I like using Mushroom cards. I have plenty
        of things integrated in HA.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to fulfill the title of this post, HA is really a great project.
        It's one of the top OSS projects, has a thriving community, and is
        positive most of the time. And I'm happy to be part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well that's it. I hope I didn't leave out anything I should've put in or
        misinterpret what a tribute is. Thanks for reading.
