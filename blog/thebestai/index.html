      <h1>AI isn't good without good UI/UX</h1>
      <p>
        This post was originally a bit of a long rant, but I changed my opinion
        since the original post. This post is now a summary of my opinion then
        and my opinion now.
      </p>
      <h2>Then</h2>
      <p>
        Google's AI looks good. ChatGPT looks good. But Bing has inconsistent
        UI, and fails to find the pages I need in both the search and chat.
      </p>
      <h2>Now</h2>
      <p>
        I got access to Google's Generative AI. It looks nice but the triggering
        mechanism is weird (sometimes it shows, sometimes it asks if you want,
        sometimes it doesn't). When it asks if you want to see the overview,
        sometimes it then just says it's not available. The Converse UI is weird
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been learning how to use Bing. In Creative mode it can actually do
        stuff. I'm using Google as my default search engine though, because it
        does the job while looking good.
