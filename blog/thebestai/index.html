      <h1>AI isn't good without good UI/UX</h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft has been working on AI with OpenAI lately. That's cool, but
        UI/UX still matters. And they seem to not realize that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now don't get me wrong, I love Fluent design (especially the ads - those
        are so satisfying). All my wallpapers are Microsoft wallpapers. I'm even
        physically close to Microsoft HQ. But Microsoft has a reputation of
        inconsistent design, and that hasn't gotten any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bing has a quality problem.</strong> I used Bing for a while.
        While programming, I would sometimes try to find a solution to an error
        or whatever. I tried multiple queries with Bing, and nothing showed up.
        So then I go to Google, and what I need is the first result. This let to
        a habit of me going to Google for search results, despite my default
        search engine being Bing (it's not anymore). Bing just had lower quality
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bing has a reputation for that - it's
        <a href="https://media.tenor.com/jRjIJoOkqcAAAAAd/meme-downloading.gif">
          part of meme culture</a
        >. Bing AI was supposed to change that. And yet it didn't. Sometimes it
        just repeats back the search results, even if they're totally
        irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's advertised as being able to do wacky tasks. It failed to use basic
        reasoning and understand the 3 things it needed to look up to solve "how
        long would you need to use microsoft rewards to buy amazon" (to be fair,
        it can do this in the Creative mode, but why not in the other modes?).
        It's advertised for being able to reject stuff, yet the content filter
        triggers randomly when I'm just asking it about code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now back to UI. Bing's UI is not consistent - the Chat UI feels out of
        place, and there isn't visual harmony among the other elements. There
        isn't any dark mode either. I'm not going to even get into what they did
        with all their mobile apps. Other Microsoft apps that they're going to
        inject Copilot into will have the same problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Everyone else has been doing great.</strong> The official
        ChatGPT UI looks amazing (and has dark mode). Google's overall design
        theme for Google's AI products is consistent, and has a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DaJVZBXETE">
          fantastic typing animation
        </a>
        (and has dark mode). I would expect to see the advertised UI actually in
        Google products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that's all. AI isn't good without good UI and UX. I don't know
        if Microsoft (or anyone else) cares, but that's my opinion.
