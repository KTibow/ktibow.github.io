      <h1>What <em>is</em> Focus SIS</h1>
      <p>
        Focus SIS is a student information system (SIS) used to manage student
        data, including attendance and grades. Like many other SISs, it looks
        outdated, but it has a relatively unique history.
      </p>
      <h2>The start: Centre</h2>
      <p>
        Back in Andrew Schmadeke's college years (2004), he made the original
        Centre with The Miller Group

        >. It was open software under the GPL. However, after a couple of years,
        he switched things up a bit.
      </p>

      <h2>Focus of 2006</h2>
      <p>
        In 2006
        <cite
          ><a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060515181645/http://focus-sis.org/"
            >2</a
          ></cite
        >
        Andrew moved his development efforts to a fork: Focus SIS by Focus
        School Software.
      </p>
      <p>
        They let you download the code until March 2008
        <cite
          ><a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080315092016/http://www.focus-sis.org/download.php"

          ></cite
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also had a simple $19/mo through Big Wow Web Hosting plan until
        March 2008.
      </p>
      <h2>Related projects: Centre and Rosario</h2>
      <p>
        In 2009, possibly prompted by Andrew's actions, a few organizations
        (Glenn-Abbey software, an original hoster, and Learners Circle, a new
        LLC) gave Centre a second life. They took up development without Andrew

        and released many free and paid updates. (The paid updates might've
        violated the GPL. Too late now - Learners Circle is gone.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2013, Fran√ßois Jacquet extended on this updated Centre to make
        Rosario SIS. Shout out to it for being the only actively maintained and
        public fork of Centre and helping me figure out this history.
      </p>
      <h2>The Focus of today</h2>
      <p>
        Andrew Schmadeke has been a constant through many redesigns and revamps.
        He's still the CEO and supposedly micromanages a bit. The company has
        also made some interesting decisions since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Focus has kept around its legacy code, it's been growing
        since. They dropped the download link in March 2008 and the "open
        source" branding in November 2012. Many features and integrations have
        been added, and it's replaced many other SISs.
