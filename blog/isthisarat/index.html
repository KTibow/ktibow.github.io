          <a href="https://isthisarat.com/">Is This A Rat</a> is a site made by
          Vytal where you can check if a jar is a rat using AI

          A rat refers to a Skyblock mod that lets the attacker log on to your
          Minecraft account,

        Problem 1: Is This A Rat uses AI. Actually the site has a hash database,
        but falls back to AI. We don't know what this AI does, but it has plenty
        of false positives and false negatives. Recently I asked him about it,
        and his approach seems to be security by obscurity, as all he would tell
        me is that it's an ensemble model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 2: The UI. It had a old design until I made a PR with a new
        version. Then they messed with the UI again, adding hover styling where
        there shouldn't be, editing auto-generated code, and hiding the AI's
        confidence. There are some other confusing parts, like how it shows
        regex that match the jar (what does that mean? does it affect the
        score?) and how it once accepted discord servers for the Discord Link
        box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 3: The community. Is This A Rat has a Discord where users can
        get files checked or just chat. Here you can see the previous two
        problems manifesting. Also a fair bit of drama happens. For example,
        take the story of the user Gute Nacht. They were once made malicious
        mods, then decided to go against ratting, and got the File Checker role.
        Then once they had some criticism about it they got banned. That's Vytal
        for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the biggest problem is that Is This A Rat's AI can give
        incorrect results. This could lead to false accusations, or people
        getting their account stolen. Instead you should get manual checks
        (whether in IsThisARat's Discord or Vanta).

        You can also use tools that show you possible flags like
        <a href="https://ktibow.github.io/RatRater/">RatRater</a>
        <a href="https://ktibow.github.io/RatRater2/">
          (or 2, which has less flags but better browsing)</a
        >. Compared to the other options, RatRater is not definitive. It gives
        you a list of possible flags to investigate. Whatever you do, just stay
        safe out there.
