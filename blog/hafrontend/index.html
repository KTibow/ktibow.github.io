      <h1>My gripes with the HA frontend</h1>
      <h2>Slow dev workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The frontend uses Webpack. This means that a lot has to be rebuilt every
        time that something changes. There's also no HMR, so you have to
        manually reload the page. This makes dev slower.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem] not-prose">
        <p class="font-bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" class="underline text-white">Vite</a> -
          has a dev server with a faster feedback loop.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Slow build workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The build workflow takes 15 minutes. Imagine I'm trying to change
        something in the build workflow - I only get to try out 3 changes every
        hour, not an enjoyable experience.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem] not-prose">
        <p class="font-bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          1. Make the prebuild steps run in parallel, be cached, preprepared,
          etc
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Switch to Vite for faster JS building (Rollup is fast and Rolldown
          is going to be even faster)
        </p>
        <p>3. Build with Brotli instead of Zopfli</p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Some argue that we should stick with Zopfli because gzip has better
          browser support. Here's a diagram to demonstrate that we can implement
          Brotli without worrying about this.
        </p>
        <div class="flex gap-2">
          <div style="flex-basis: 60%" class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem]">
            <p class="font-bold">99% of browsers recieve Brotli</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Get better compression than Zopfli</p>
          </div>
          <div style="flex-basis: 40%" class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem]">
            <p class="font-bold">7 year old browsers recieve Gzip</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Get decent on-the-fly compression</p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              This is standard and fast - a chunk can be gzipped in around 10ms
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Slow load times</h2>
      <p>Big bundles make loading slow. Why are the bundles big though?</p>
      <p>
        Webpack is one reason - modules are all or nothing, meaning a whole file
        may be loaded even if you only needed part of it. Switching to Vite will
        fix this as it uses Rollup.
      </p>
      <p>
        MWC is another. When we finally switch to only material-web, this will
        likely help decrease our bundle sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Intl polyfills are another cause, as these add a base size to all
        entry points.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem] not-prose">
        <p class="font-bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          Switch to Vite, switch to material-web, and switch to a custom message
          formatter.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>The way that packages are managed</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the frontend has too many dependencies. Some of these
        were added in just so a card could work. Others were added in so an
        alternative way of frontend development works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a visualization of the dependencies. I didn't make this a grid
        because the human mind tends to underestimate the number of objects in a
        grid.
      </p>
      <div id="deps" class="flex overflow-auto gap-2 items-center">
        <p class="m-0 flex-none">scroll horizontally</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This makes it take a long time to install packages whenever you make a
        new dev environment.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-white/10 p-4 rounded-[1.5rem] not-prose">
        <p class="font-bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          Small packages can be inlined or replaced with vanilla JS
          implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystems with large packages (like formatjs or MWC) can be moved to
          other ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>Ecosystems not really needed (like WDS) can be removed.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        I also don't like yarn, I like pnpm more (it does symlinks and feels
        faster), but that's just a matter of preference.
      </p>
      <h2>Have I tried to fix these?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. I've tried to make a version of the HA frontend using Vite with
        varying success, and I've tried to get some changes merged in. I
        couldn't do much with Vite since the code base has a lot of complexity,
        and many of the changes I tried to get merged sadly got rejected.
