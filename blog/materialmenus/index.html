      <h1>Material menus are goofy</h1>
      <p>
        Menus have been part of Material Design for a while. I have been using
        Material Design for a while. Both are still true in the present. But
        <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview">
          Material's menus</a
        >
        are goofy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 1: The styling. Material's menus are barely rounded despite most
        things being ultra-rounded in Material 3. They're rounded to 4px. They
        could be rounded more - in fact as of writing, the Menu docs say
        "Medium" (12px) in one place, but that's probably just a typo as are
        common on the M3 docs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 2: The sizing. The menus tend to be really chonky. The most
        likely reason is so they're tappable (each item must be 48px high), but
        cmon. You have examples of dense menus under Guidelines, GDocs has dense
        menus, why can't you add dense menus as a spec?
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 3: The animation. I've never seen a good Material menu
        animation. Sometimes it's a translate-in, sometimes a scale-in,
        sometimes a clip-in, but it never looks good. In Chrome Mobile it's even
        worse, as there's a 1-second delay as all the items animate in. Why
        can't they just use a container transform or something?
