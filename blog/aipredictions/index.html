      <h1>2024 AI predictions</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>AI that processes information on the scale of time</p>
          <p>
            Similar to what we saw in the Gemini demo, I predict that there's
            going to be some sort of AI that instead of being initiated can
            process information over time and understand when to jump in. This
            means chatbots that feel more real. For example you could have a bot
            in a Discord server that jumps in whenever someone uses a logical
            fallacy, while understanding all the context.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>AI that can iterate on its response</p>
          <p>
            GPT-4 is so good because it has so many internal layers. But if AI
            could think step by step, think about multiple options, think if its
            code would actually work, and then change its response, that might
            reduce the number of layers required.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Another GPT version</p>
          <p>
            Past GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo, there's probably going to be a GPT-4.5
            or GPT-5 in 2024, given the speed of things.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm excited for what 2024 will bring.</p>
