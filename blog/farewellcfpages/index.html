      <h1>What Do You Do When Cloudflare Pages Gets Blocked?</h1>
      <p>
        Cloudflare Pages is an absolutely awesome platform. Thanks to
        Cloudflare's customers, it's completely subsidized, and provides
        generous static and dynamic hosting. I host almost all my SvelteKit
        projects on it, and when combined with SvelteKit's prefetching, it is
        incredibly fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, recently my district blocked Cloudflare Pages for being a
        "games" site. At the same time, other static hosting sites are
        unblocked. This is unjust: "bad actors" (kids who want to play games)
        can simply make more GitHub Pages while I have to find new hosting
        platforms. I've tried to argue this point to no avail, so it's time to
        make sure I can access my projects from school.
      </p>
      <h2>What Other Platforms Can I Use?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub Pages (limited to static stuff)</li>
        <li>Fly</li>
        <li>Azure App Service</li>
        <li>Azure Functions (limited to dynamic stuff)</li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-family: Redacted Script">Rti</span> (limited to
          dynamic stuff)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-family: Redacted Script">Cmersio</span> (possibly
          used as <span style="font-family: Redacted Script">blotyr</span>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How Will My Public-Ish Dynamic-Ish Projects Work?</h2>
      <p>
        After an awful lot of ideating, I've decided to move certain, more
        useful projects to my GitHub Pages. They'll make cross origin calls to
        servers to load data when needed. This is the fastest, cheapest, and
        most sustainable option.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to use Azure Functions, which has the drawback of having
        terrible logging. If you're ever in my shoes, things will be a lot
        easier if you use the CLI directly and include the word "pnpm" in your
        queries about why functions aren't showing up.
