      <h1>Grade math</h1>
      <p>
        For a bit now I've been experimenting with grade math. That is,
        recalculating your grade, sometimes under different circumstances. Some
        of this got programmed into an internal app that analyzes your grades;
        today we're covering what didn't, or what's just interesting.
      </p>
      <h2>StudentVue has inaccurate percents</h2>
      <p>
        StudentVue has odd and inconsistent rounding. Sometimes it rounds in
        your favor (eg 94.86% is shown as 95% and 93.63% is shown as 94%); but
        I've observed it rounding down for no good reason before.
      </p>
      <h2>StudentVue's "TOTAL" points are wrong (or at least misleading)</h2>
      <p>
        In a class that uses weighted grading, StudentVue will let you view a
        grid. In the class we'll reference in this post, it looks something like
        this:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Assignment Type</th>
          <th>Weight</th>
          <th>Points</th>
          <th>Points Possible</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Assignments</td>
          <td>40%</td>
          <td>86.00</td>
          <td>86.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Projects</td>
          <td>60%</td>
          <td>96.00</td>
          <td>105.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TOTAL</td>
          <td>100%</td>
          <td>182.00</td>
          <td>191.00</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        This gives you enough information to properly calculate your grade, like
        <math>
          <mn>0.4</mn>
          <mo>(</mo>
          <mfrac><mn>86</mn><mn>86</mn></mfrac>
          <mo>)</mo>
          <mo>+</mo>
          <mn>0.6</mn>
          <mo>(</mo>
          <mfrac><mn>96</mn><mn>105</mn></mfrac>
          <mo>)</mo> </math
        >. Note that this is not 182/191, as the TOTAL section would make you
        think. No, the TOTAL section is unweighted, and you need to weight the
        categories properly.
      </p>
      <h2>There is an objectively best place to put an assignment</h2>
      <p>
        If you ever get the opportunity to choose which category an assignment
        goes in, whether it's extra credit or not, know that it shouldn't just
        go in your lowest category.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should instead find which category has the most % value per point.
        For example, in my reference class, one assignment point is worth
        <math>
          <mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>86</mn></mfrac>
          <mo>*</mo>
          <mn>40%</mn> </math
        >, or <math><mn>0.47%</mn></math
        >, while one project point is <math><mn>0.57%</mn></math
        >. So in this class, extra credit should go in the projects category.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        If the assignment isn't extra credit, you should add the number of
        points to the category's possible points.
      </p>
      <h2>A point regained is an assignment earned</h2>
      <img src="./desmos-graph.svg" />
      <p>
        This is a graph showing the impact of points added on my grade. It's
        clear that red is linear and more efficient at increasing my grade,
        while blue shows a reciprocal relationship.
      </p>
      <h3>a point regained</h3>
      <p>
        When you revise or turn in an existing assignment, or get extra credit,
        you directly increase your grade. This is linear, and reflected as the
        <span class="text-red-300">red</span> line in the graph.
      </p>
      <h3>an assignment earned</h3>
      <p>
        When a new assignment goes in your grade, it squishes out other
        assignments in its category. This can be shown using bars.
      </p>
      <p>My grade:</p>
      <div class="flex h-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-full">
        <div class="bg-green-500 rounded-full" style="width: 94.86%"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
        <div class="bg-green-500 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
        Points earned
        <div class="bg-neutral-800 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
        Points lost
      </div>
      <p>My grade, with a 40 point assignment:</p>
      <div class="flex h-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-full">
        <div class="bg-green-500 rounded-full" style="width: 79.72%"></div>
        <div class="bg-blue-500 rounded-full" style="width: 16.55%"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
        <div class="bg-green-500 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
        Points earned
        <div class="bg-blue-500 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
        Assignment
        <div class="bg-neutral-800 w-4 h-4 rounded-full"></div>
        Points lost
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can see, the only reason it increases my grade is it squishing
        out points I lost. This is a reciprocal relationship, has diminishing
        returns, and is reflected as the
        <span class="text-blue-300">blue</span> line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to this, regaining points has much more of an effect on grades than
        adding assignments. To get my grade to 96%, you could either add 2
        points, or add an assignment that is 30/30 points.
