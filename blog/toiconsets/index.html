      <h1>How I published 165 icon sets to NPM</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Iconify is a great collection of all sorts of icon sets. It's used
            by all sorts of libraries.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I love to use these icons in my apps by embedding the raw SVGs. I
            could do this with something like
          </p>
          <pre>
&lt;script&gt;
  import iconAdd from "@iconify-icons/ic/add";
  import Icon from "$lib/Icon.svelte";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;Icon icon={iconAdd} /&gt;
</pre
          >
          <p>
            This is the best way because it results in the smallest bundle
            sizes, while preventing flashes while the icons are loading.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            But recently Iconify seems to have taken a tyrade against importing
            raw SVGs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They say that you should use the web component instead of your
              framework-specific component. This makes it impossible to ship the
              icon before JS loads, requiring a flash while the icons are still
              loading.
            </li>
            <li>
              They updated the Svelte exports so that it's no longer possible to
              access the built in OfflineIcon, which bundles smaller than the
              Icon component.
            </li>
            <li>
              They
              <a href="https://iconify.design/docs/icons/icons">deprecated</a>
              the packages with raw SVGs, forcing you to use another method to
              get updated icons. This is the subject of today's post, because I
              still want to use these.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Hiccups along the way</h2>
      <p>
        The first major problem I had was that the docs for libnpmpublish are
        incorrect in how to pass the token. It doesn't help that NPM has
        unintuitive error codes, but I found the solution:
        <a href="https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4250"
          >using <code>forceAuth</code></a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next one was setting the version - some icon sets have
        <code>info.version</code>, some don't. Some have
        <code>lastUpdated</code>, some don't. I ended up 1. skipping sets with 0
        icons 2. using version if there 3. if not, convert lastUpdated to a
        semver-esque version.
      </p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <a
        href="https://github.com/KTibow/to-icon-sets"
        class="p-4 bg-neutral-800 rounded-[1.5rem] block no-underline"
      >
        <b>to-icon-sets</b><br />GitHub
      </a>
      <p>Use GitHub Actions to host the following process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download JSON icon data from Iconify</li>
        <li>Use <code>@iconify/tools</code> to convert them to packages</li>
        <li>
          Publish them on NPM as <code>@ktibow/iconset-&lt;name&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means that as soon as Iconify gets updates, our packages will get
        updates near-automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning: As of publication, a few sets are broken because I can't
        publish them for 24 hours since I unpublished them before. These will
        fix themselves soon.
