  <h2>School arc</h2>
  <p>
    Sep 2025-now: Something new (backed by <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/monoserve"
      >Monoserve</a
    >,
    <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/monoidentity">Monoidentity</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/school-districts">school-districts</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    June 2025-August 2025: A failed attempt to rewrite Tangent (I learned that it makes sense to
    keep apps separate)
  </p>
  <p>
    September 2024: <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/practiceyeet">PracticeYeet</a>, a copy of
    PracticeIt but the graders are inferred by AI that was going swimmingly until I accidentally
    <code>DELETE</code>d too much.
  </p>
  <p>October 2024: Pln, a website for planning schedules with a modern UI.</p>

    June 2024: <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/1984">1984</a>, a search engine that drops results
    blocked for me.
  </p>
  <p>June 2024: Stereotype, an experiment with text-image search.</p>
  <p>
    March 2024-June 2025: Tangent, a collection of utilities. Tangent was one of my most ambitious
    projects, and I had to learn many different patterns across deployment, backend logic, and
    frontend logic. However, after a number of bad days (with ~nobody coming to my help), I was so
    tired I had to shut it down.
  </p>
  <p>
    May 2023-February 2024: SchoolHub (new), a collection of utilities. This was the first time I
    experimented with growth, and it worked! Until it got shut down.
  </p>
  <p>
    May 2023: I made something where you could make GPT-3.5 instances self-rap battle or generate
    stupid "what if"s. It was fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    March 2023-February 2024: Sussable. The first chat app that experienced growth, based on web
    notifications.
  </p>
  <p>January 2023: I tried to make BeReal but for school. I lost motivation.</p>
  <p>
    August 2022-December 2022: SchoolHub (old), an experiment with connecting to school APIs. This
    was where today's connectors that cope with yesterday's XML and OAuth were written.

  <h2>SkyClient arc</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://skyclient.co/">SkyClient</a>, even if a little weird (I wish I found X earlier
    to counterbalance), was a nice place to dump my thoughts and my time into 2022-2024. I built 2
    bots, an installer (arguably 2 or 3), a website, and a number of edits. I acted with too high
    agency and too low EQ/self consciousness a few times, but overall I'm glad for it.
