<BlogHeader {bg} title="MCP from first principles" />
<p>
  MCP (at its core) is a standard for providing tools to LLMs. If I were to ask you to write a spec
  for MCP, it would probably look something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A <code>/list</code> endpoint. This endpoint only accepts <code>GET</code> responses and returns
    a JSON response with the type
    <code
      >&#123; tools: &#123; name: string; description: string; inputSchema: JSONSchema &#125;[]
      &#125;</code
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <code>/call</code> endpoint. This endpoint only accepts <code>POST</code> responses with a
    type of <code>&#123; tool: string; input: JSON &#125;</code>, and returns a JSON response with
    the type <code>string</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Yet it's many times more complex than this. To understand why, I first need to ask you how you'd
  write another spec: MCP with local servers. Since it would be wasteful to restart an application
  every tool call or run a pointless HTTP server, you'd use standard IO. Clients send in a numbered
  call, the server receives it on standard input, and it replies on standard output for the client
  to read. Simple enough, and MCP agrees with you on this - it likes streaming a lot. In fact, it
  likes it so much that remote MCPs also stream.
</p>
<p>
  How would you write a spec for using streaming to make MCPs work remotely? You'd probably use
  WebSockets since this is a bidirectional stream. But here we flip back to MCP being many times
  more complex than you'd expect. There are two ways to connect to a remote MCP server:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Central SSE + separate calls.</strong> This was the first implementation of remote MCP,
    and makes each client receive responses through an always open connection to <code>/sse</code>
    and send requests by POSTing to <code>/messages</code>. This split is inherently problematic,
    which leads us to...
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Streamable HTTP.</strong> It's a name that promises a return to the basics from the
    start of this post, but it in fact isn't. With most servers, everything works by POSTing
    something to
    <code>/mcp</code>
    and getting a stream back. Most will require you to <code>initialize</code> yourself to get a
    <code>mcp-session-id</code>, then use it for all other call requests. Most keep the stream open
    for 10 seconds after sending back the main data.
  </li>
  <li>

<p>
  We can cope with this though. Streamable HTTP, however problematically designed, is usable. Take a
  look.

<p>
  That was a minimal MCP-over-streamable HTTP client in &lt;100 lines of TypeScript. It's not
  compatible with servers that don't respond to an RPC with a single, same-stream response, lacks
  authentication, doesn't support many parts of the MCP spec, and probably isn't suitable for
  production. But most importantly: it isn't bloated.
