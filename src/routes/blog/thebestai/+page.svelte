  This post was originally a bit of a long rant, but I changed my opinion since the original post.
  This post is now a summary of my opinion then and my opinion now.
</p>
<h2>Then</h2>
<p>
  Google's AI looks good. ChatGPT looks good. But Bing has inconsistent UI, and fails to find the
  pages I need in both the search and chat.
</p>
<h2>Now</h2>
<p>
  I got access to Google's Generative AI. It looks nice but the triggering mechanism is weird
  (sometimes it shows, sometimes it asks if you want, sometimes it doesn't). When it asks if you
  want to see the overview, sometimes it then just says it's not available. The Converse UI is weird
  too.
</p>

  I've been learning how to use Bing. In Creative mode it can actually do stuff. I'm using Google as
  my default search engine though, because it does the job while looking good.
