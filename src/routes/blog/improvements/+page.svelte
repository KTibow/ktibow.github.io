<BlogHeader title="Life improvements I've done" />
<p>Note: I wrote this on a plane because I got bored. I didn't have internet.</p>
<p>
  This is somewhat inspired by me coming onto some guy's blog (while researching adaptive-lighting)
  where he talks about how he did a project where he spent some time improving his life.
