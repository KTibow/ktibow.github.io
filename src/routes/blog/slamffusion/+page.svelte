<p>
  SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, a robotics technique for when you need to
  use sensor data to accurately build a map and find yourself in it. It's about compensating for
  noisy data by using constraints like common landmarks and loop closures to either find the most
  likely solution (particle/Kalman-based) or the least bad solution (graph optimization-based).
</p>
<p>
  Wait. Denoising. Isn't that what diffusion models are really good at? Could SLAM Diffusion or
  Diffusion SLAM work? Short answer: unfortunately it hasn't for me.
</p>
<p>
  Thing with images is that they're convenient to represent. It's just a grid of pixels. You can
  split it into its channels, scale it down, or throw it into an autoencoder, but it doesn't get any
  more complex to handle. But to do SLAM, you need to denoise location, and so you need to denoise
  trajectories, and so you must represent trajectories somehow. And there are so many ways to do
  that.
</p>
<p class="italic">
  To start, we aren't even adding sensors. The question is just "can the model learn how to generate
  trajectories that look like what it was trained on". For my purposes, my trajectories were
  Roomba-like, mostly straight but bouncing off of walls and a divider. Back to representing the
  trajectories:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Represent each move as how much the left and right wheels have changed. Or represent it as the
    sum of all time and hope that the model learns how to make its convolutions subtract. Remember
    to supplement with dead reckoning since the model won't figure out absolute position from just
    the wheel data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Represent each move as a vector (whether polar or Cartesian). Or an absolute position. Hope this
    doesn't break the model's model of turning in place.
  </li>
  <li>
    Represent each move as a pose (x, y, theta) delta. Or an absolute pose. Hope that implicitly
    forcing the model to learn sine and cosine isn't problematic.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Even if you have a good representation, you still need to train the model. But how? What will you
  input? What will be simply conditioned? How will you architecture the insides? What will come out
  the other end? What do you calculate loss on?
</p>
<p>
  And what type of noise do you add? How do you add (or mix) it? Does the model get to know the step
  of denoising it's on?
</p>
<p>
  Say you figured out the implementation details, all of this worked, and you now have a model that
  can denoise a trajectory or create a trajectory from nothingness. Now how do you go the rest of
  the way, to replacing SLAM? You'll need to somehow make your model learn about loop closures and
  landmarks from there, likely having to figure out how to use attention. You'll have to also make
  sure the synthetic noise matches real noise.
</p>
<p>
  Sorry if you were hoping for the usual "I made this!" on this blog. This is truly a skill issue.
  If I knew more about diffusion or had access to stronger LLMs I could probably make this work. In
  fact, I might come back to this later and try again. However, for the time being, you can look at
  how I failed.
