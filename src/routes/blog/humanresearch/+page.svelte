<p>
  Deep Research is neat, but in my experience Gemini/Perplexity/Grok/Manus's versions aren't as good
  as the OpenAI or human experience. They often don't actually answer my question. As such, I've
  switched over to doing research myself and publishing it here for anyone who needs it, even
  including AI.

  Here are the current pages. They're typically short since they just restate info in a more
  crawler-friendly form. More are continously being added.
