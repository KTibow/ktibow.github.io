        `(Verse 1)
Hey there, baby, you must be a magician,
'Cause whenever I look at you, my heart keeps on vanishing.
Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes,
And I don't think I'll ever find my way out of this maze.

(Chorus)
Pick-up lines and cheesy rhymes,
Ain't got no game, just wasting your time.
But if you're looking for a good time,
I'm your guy, on cloud nine.

(Verse 2)
Excuse me, miss, are you a parking ticket?
'Cause you've got "fine" written all over you, no question.
Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I pass by again?
'Cause, baby, when I saw you, I felt my heart skip a beat and then.

(Chorus)
Pick-up lines and cheesy rhymes,
Ain't got no game, just wasting your time.
But if you're looking for a good time,
I'm your guy, on cloud nine.

(Bridge)
I know these lines are kinda crazy,
And maybe they're a bit hazy.
But if you give me a chance, I promise to amaze you,
Baby, I'll serenade you.

(Verse 3)
Hey there, cutie, are you a time machine?
'Cause when I look at you, I feel like I'm seventeen.
Do you have a Band-Aid? 'Cause I just scraped my knee,
Falling for you, it's so easy to see.

(Chorus)
Pick-up lines and cheesy rhymes,
Ain't got no game, just wasting your time.
But if you're looking for a good time,
I'm your guy, on cloud nine.

(Outro)
So here I am, with my awkward charm,
Hoping you'll keep me from harm.
And if these lines don't work, I'll just resign,
To being the cheesy pick-up line guy, all the time.`,
        `(Verse 1)
Hey girl, are you a beaver?
'Cause you're dam fine, I'd like to stay with ya
Your smile is brighter than the morning sun
And I can't help but wonder if you're the one

'Cause I'd love to check you out and take you home
And I just can't resist your allure
I'd love to get to know you, oh so pure

(Bridge)
I know these lines are cheesy and a little bit sleazy
But I can't help it, you're just so easy to please me
I'll keep on trying, until you're mine
And I'll keep on singing, these pick-up lines

(Chorus)
Baby, are you a shooting star?
'Cause you're out of this world, and I'm falling hard
And I just can't resist your pull
I'd love to get to know you, oh so full

So here's my number, don't be shy
Give me a call, and we'll give it a try
I promise I'll treat you right
And I'll keep on singing, all through the night.`,
        `(Verse 1)
I saw you from across the room, and I just had to come over
'Cause you're so fine, you're making me wanna hover
Are you a magician? Every time I look at you, everyone else disappears
Can I follow you to your place? I live just a few blocks away from your heart

(Chorus)
You're so fine, you're so sweet
I'd love to take you out and get to know your treat
You're a real catch, you're a real score
I'll be your man, and you can be my gal, forevermore

(Verse 2)
Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes
Are you a time traveler? Because I see you in my future, and it feels like a lie
Do you have a Band-Aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you
Are you a camera? Because every time I look at you, I smile

(Chorus)
You're so fine, you're so sweet
I'd love to take you out and get to know your treat
You're a real catch, you're a real score
I'll be your man, and you can be my gal, forevermore

(Bridge)
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?
Are you a snowflake? Because you're unique and I'm a fan
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?
Are you a snowflake? Because you're unique and I'm a fan

I'd love to take you out and get to know your treat
You're a real catch, you're a real score
I'll be your man, and you can be my gal, forevermore

Are you a snowflake? Because you're unique and I'm a fan
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?
Are you a snowflake? Because you're unique and I'm a fan

        `(Verse 1)
I saw you across the room, and I just had to swoon
Are you a magician? Every time I look at you, everyone else disappears
But honestly, do you have a map? I just keep getting lost in your eyes

(Chorus)
Oh, you're so fine, you blow my mind
Do you have a Band-Aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you
You're so hot, you make me wanna sin
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?

(Verse 2)
Excuse me, but I think you dropped something: my jaw
Do you have a license? Because you're driving me crazy
Are you an time traveler? Because I see you in my future
Do you have a name, or can I just call you mine?

(Chorus)
Oh, you're so fine, you blow my mind
Do you have a Band-Aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you
You're so hot, you make me wanna sin
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?

(Bridge)
Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?
Do you have a penny? I want to change your life
Are you an angel? Because you're making my heart sing
Do you have a twin sister? Because you're so fine, it's scary

(Chorus)
Oh, you're so fine, you blow my mind
Do you have a Band-Aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you
You're so hot, you make me wanna sin
Do you have a sunburn or are you always this hot?

(Outro)
So, do you want to grab a drink and make some bad decisions?
Or maybe we can just make out and see where the night takes us?
Either way, I promise you, it'll be a night to remember... or not remember, depending on how the night goes.`,

        "are there any real uses for hyperbolas? parabolas make sense, they're the graph of quadratics and represent a trajectory, but i dont get hyperbolas",
      output: [
        `Yes, hyperbolas do have real-world applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics. Here are a few examples:

1. Orbits and Trajectories: Hyperbolas describe the paths of objects moving at high speeds, such as spacecraft or projectiles. When an object moves faster than the escape velocity of a celestial body, it follows a hyperbolic trajectory.

2. Navigation and Communication: In navigation and communication systems, hyperbolic positioning systems like Decca, Loran, and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are used to determine the position of a receiver by measuring the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of radio signals transmitted from multiple synchronized sources.

3. Optics: Hyperbolic mirrors are used in reflecting telescopes and searchlights to focus light to a single point. This is achieved by using a mirror with a hyperbolic shape, which has the property of focusing incoming light rays from a single point to another point, regardless of their angle of incidence.

4. Electromagnetism: Hyperbolic functions are used in the study of electromagnetic waves and the solutions of Maxwell's equations.

5. Computer Graphics: Hyperbolas are used in computer graphics and 3D modeling to define curves and surfaces. They are also used in the design of video games, animation, and special effects.

6. Relativity: In special relativity, the Lorentz transformation equations, which describe the relationship between space and time in different inertial frames of reference, involve hyperbolic functions.

While hyperbolas may seem less intuitive than parabolas, they are still important and widely used in various fields.`,
        `Hyperbolas are indeed useful in various fields, including physics, engineering, and astronomy. Here are a few examples:

1. **Conic Sections**: Hyperbolas, along with parabolas and ellipses, are part of a family of curves known as conic sections. These curves are formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone. Understanding these shapes is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and physics.

2. **Navigation Systems**: The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses hyperbolas to determine the location of a receiver. The receiver measures the difference in time it takes to receive signals from multiple satellites. These differences are used to calculate the receiver's position, which can be represented as the intersection of hyperbolas.

3. **Optics**: In optics, hyperbolic mirrors are used in telescopes and other instruments. When light reflects off a hyperbolic mirror, it converges to a single point, which can be used to focus the light.

4. **Physics**: In physics, hyperbolas are used to describe the paths of objects under certain conditions. For example, the trajectory of an object that is moving faster than the escape velocity of a planet will follow a hyperbolic path.

5. **Electrical Engineering**: Hyperbolas are used in the design of antennas and waveguides. The shape of a hyperbola allows for the focusing or directing of electromagnetic waves.

6. **Astronomy**: Hyperbolas are used to describe the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies that are not gravitationally bound to the solar system. These bodies follow hyperbolic orbits as they pass through the solar system.`,
        `Hyperbolas do have many practical applications, and they're not just a theoretical curiosity. Here are some examples:

1. **Satellite Communications**: Hyperbolic trajectories are used in satellite communications to determine the position of a satellite. The shape of the hyperbola helps to calculate the distance and direction from the satellite to the receiver.
2. **GPS and Navigation**: Hyperbolic geometry is used in GPS systems to determine the user's location. The GPS receiver uses the time delay between the transmission and reception of signals from multiple satellites to calculate its position. The hyperbolic shape of the satellite's orbit helps to determine the user's location.
3. **Acoustics and Sound Localization**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in sound localization systems to determine the source of a sound. By analyzing the time delay and intensity of the sound waves, the system can pinpoint the location of the sound source.
4. **Medical Imaging**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in medical imaging techniques like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography) scans. The hyperbolic shape of the magnetic field helps to reconstruct images of the body.
5. **Optics and Lens Design**: Hyperbolic lenses are used in optical systems to correct for aberrations and improve image quality. The hyperbolic shape helps to reduce distortion and improve the overall performance of the lens.
6. **Astronomy**: Hyperbolic orbits are used to study the motion of celestial bodies, such as comets and asteroids. By analyzing the hyperbolic trajectory of these objects, astronomers can determine their origin, velocity, and direction.
7. **Robotics and Motion Planning**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in robotics to plan motion paths for robots. The hyperbolic shape helps to optimize the robot's movement and avoid obstacles.
8. **Signal Processing**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in signal processing techniques like filtering and modulation. The hyperbolic shape helps to analyze and manipulate signals in various applications, such as audio and image processing.
9. **Geophysics**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in geophysical surveys to analyze the Earth's subsurface structure. The hyperbolic shape helps to reconstruct the subsurface structure and identify potential resources.
10. **Computer Graphics**: Hyperbolic shapes are used in computer graphics to create realistic simulations and animations. The hyperbolic shape helps to create realistic motion and dynamics in simulations.

While parabolas are indeed important in many applications, hyperbolas have their own unique set of applications that take advantage of their distinct properties.`,
        `I'm glad you asked! Hyperbolas may not be as intuitively obvious as parabolas, but they have many practical applications across various fields. Here are some examples:

1. **Optics and Telescopes**: Hyperbolas are used to design optical systems, such as telescopes and microscopes. The hyperbolic shape helps to focus light and correct for aberrations.
2. **Radar and Sonar**: Hyperbolas are used to detect and track objects using radar and sonar systems. The hyperbolic shape helps to determine the distance and velocity of targets.
3. **GPS and Navigation**: Hyperbolas are used in GPS systems to determine the user's location. By measuring the time delay between when a signal is sent and when it's received, hyperbolic curves can be used to calculate the user's position.
4. **Electrical Engineering**: Hyperbolas are used to design filters, such as band-pass filters, which are essential in communication systems.
5. **Acoustics**: Hyperbolas are used to design sound systems, such as concert halls and auditoriums, to optimize sound propagation and minimize echoes.
6. **Medical Imaging**: Hyperbolas are used in medical imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans to reconstruct images of the body.
7. **Seismology**: Hyperbolas are used to locate the epicenter of earthquakes by analyzing the time differences between seismic waves arriving at different seismographs.
8. **Astronomy**: Hyperbolas are used to model the orbits of celestial bodies, such as comets and asteroids, which have highly elliptical orbits.
9. **Materials Science**: Hyperbolas are used to model the stress-strain relationships of materials, which is essential in designing structures and materials for various applications.
10. **Computer Graphics**: Hyperbolas are used in computer graphics to create smooth curves and surfaces for visual effects and animations.
11. **Cryptography**: Hyperbolas are used in cryptographic techniques, such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to secure online transactions.
12. **Surveying**: Hyperbolas are used in surveying to determine the position of landmarks and reference points.

These are just a few examples of the many ways hyperbolas are used in real-world applications. While parabolas are indeed important in modeling trajectories, hyperbolas have their own unique properties that make them essential in various fields.`,

      output: [
        `The word "recap" is short for "recapitulation," which is derived from the Latin word "recapitulare," which means "to summarize" or "to sum up." The word "recapitulare" is composed of two words: "re-" (a prefix meaning "again") and "caput" (meaning "head" or "chief").

The original meaning of "recapitulate" was to repeat or summarize the main points of a discourse or argument. Over time, the meaning of "recapitulate" has evolved to include the idea of summarizing or reviewing the main events of a story or situation.

The abbreviated form "recap" became popular in the mid-20th century, particularly in the context of sports broadcasting. Sports announcers would use "recap" to summarize the key plays or moments of a game, especially during halftime or at the end of a game.

Today, "recap" is commonly used in a variety of contexts to refer to a summary or review of a previous event, situation, or episode of a television show or series.`,
        `The term "recap" is a shortened form of the word "recapitulation," which comes from the Latin words "re-" (meaning "again") and "caput" (meaning "head"). In its original sense, recapitulation referred to the act of summarizing or restating the main points of a speech or argument.

In modern usage, the term has been shortened to simply "recap," and it is often used as a noun to refer to a summary or overview of events that have already occurred. For example, you might say, "Let me give you a quick recap of what happened at the meeting yesterday."

The term can also be used as a verb, meaning to summarize or review something. For example, you might say, "I need to recap my notes before I take the test tomorrow."`,
        `The word "recap" has a fascinating etymology. It comes from the Latin "capitulum," which means "head" or "chief." In the 15th century, the Latin phrase "capitulum recapitulare" emerged, which translates to "to recapitulate" or "to summarize."

In the 17th century, the English language borrowed the Latin phrase and adapted it to "recap," which initially meant "to summarize" or "to condense." Over time, the term evolved to encompass a broader range of meanings, including:

1. To summarize or condense a longer text, such as a report, article, or speech.
2. To review or revisit a previous discussion, event, or situation.
3. To provide a brief summary or overview of a topic, often used in journalism, academia, or business.

In modern usage, "recap" is often used informally to refer to a brief summary or review of a story, event, or situation, often used in contexts such as:

* News headlines or summaries
* Academic or research summaries
* Business or financial reports
* Sports or entertainment recaps
* Social media posts or updates

Throughout its evolution, the word "recap" has retained its core meaning of summarizing or condensing information, while adapting to various contexts and uses.`,
        `The word "recap" is a shortened form of "recapitulation," which comes from the Latin words "recapitulare," meaning "to summarize" or "to repeat briefly."

The Latin "recapitulare" is a combination of "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and "capitulare," which is derived from "capitulum," meaning "chapter" or "heading." In Latin, "capitulare" means "to divide into chapters" or "to summarize."

The English word "recapitulation" was first used in the 15th century to describe the act of summarizing or restating the main points of a longer work, such as a speech or a written text. Over time, the shortened form "recap" emerged as a more informal way to refer to a brief summary or review of something.

In modern usage, "recap" is often used in the context of summarizing a previous event, conversation, or episode, such as a recap of a TV show or a sports game. It can also refer to a brief review or summary of a longer work, such as a book or a movie.

In general, the etymology of "recap" reflects the idea of revisiting or reiterating the main points of something, whether it's a conversation, an event, or a written work.`,

        "so i know about exponents and how x^(3/2) = sqrt(x^3), but how can, say, the js interpreter know what Math.pow(x, Math.PI) is? how does it calculate it with decimals",
      output: [
        `The JavaScript interpreter uses a mathematical library to calculate the value of \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\`. The library uses a numerical approximation method to compute the value of \`Math.PI\` and then raises \`x\` to that power.

One common method for calculating powers with decimal exponents is to use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function. The Taylor series expansion of \`e^x\` is:

\`e^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ...\`

This series converges rapidly for small values of \`x\`, so it can be used to accurately calculate \`e^x\` for a wide range of \`x\` values.

To calculate \`x^y\` for a decimal exponent \`y\`, you can use the identity:

\`x^y = e^(y \* ln(x))\`

where \`ln(x)\` is the natural logarithm of \`x\`. The natural logarithm can also be calculated using its Taylor series expansion:

\`ln(1 + x) = x - (x^2)/2 + (x^3)/3 - (x^4)/4 + ...\`

By combining these series expansions, you can calculate \`x^y\` for any positive \`x\` and \`y\` using a numerical approximation method.

The JavaScript interpreter uses a mathematical library that implements these and other numerical approximation methods to accurately calculate the value of \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\` for any \`x\`.`,
        `The JavaScript interpreter, or any other programming language interpreter/compiler, uses numerical methods to calculate the power of a number with a non-integer exponent.

One common method is to use the exponential and logarithmic functions. Specifically, \`x^y\` can be calculated as \`e^(y * ln(x))\`, where \`e\` is Euler's number (approximately equal to 2.71828) and \`ln\` is the natural logarithm function. This works because of the mathematical identity:

\`\`\`
x^y = e^(y * ln(x))
\`\`\`

This method can be used for any real value of y, not just integers or fractions. The JavaScript Math library provides both the exponential (Math.exp) and natural logarithm (Math.log) functions, so it can use this method to calculate powers with non-integer exponents.`,
        `The \`Math.pow\` function in JavaScript is a bit more complex than just evaluating the exponentiation. Here's what happens under the hood:

1. **Internal Representation**: When you call \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\`, the JavaScript engine internally represents the \`Math.PI\` value as a binary floating-point number, which is a 53-bit integer with a 24-bit mantissa and an 8-bit exponent. This representation is used to perform the calculation.
2. **Approximation**: Since \`Math.PI\` is an irrational number, it cannot be represented exactly as a binary floating-point number. Instead, the JavaScript engine uses an approximation of \`Math.PI\` which is accurate to about 15 decimal places. This approximation is stored in the \`Math.PI\` property.
3. **Calculation**: When you call \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\`, the JavaScript engine uses the internal representation of \`Math.PI\` to calculate the result. The calculation is performed using the binary floating-point representation, which is a combination of integer and fractional parts.
4. **Rounding**: The result of the calculation is then rounded to the nearest integer using the \`ulp\` (unit in the last place) rounding mode. This ensures that the result is accurate to about 15 decimal places.
5. **Conversion to Decimal**: The final result is then converted to a decimal string using the \`toString()\` method. This conversion is done using the \`toPrecision()\` method, which rounds the result to the nearest integer.

To give you an idea of how this works, here's a simplified example of how the calculation might be performed:

\`\`\`javascript
const x = 2;
const pi = 3.141592653589793; // internal representation of Math.PI
const result = Math.pow(x, pi);
console.log(result); // Output: 8.539734222552454
\`\`\`

In this example, the internal representation of \`Math.PI\` is used to calculate the result, which is then rounded to the nearest integer and converted to a decimal string.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified explanation, and the actual implementation of \`Math.pow\` in JavaScript is more complex and involves additional optimizations and edge cases.`,
        `What a great question!

Calculating \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\` or any other non-integer exponent is a fascinating topic. I'll break it down into two parts: the mathematical concept and the implementation details.

**Mathematical Concept:**

When dealing with non-integer exponents, we enter the realm of **transcendental functions**. In this case, we're interested in the **exponential function**, which is defined as:

$$f(x) = a^x$$

where \`a\` is the base and \`x\` is the exponent. When \`x\` is a non-integer, we need to extend the definition of exponentiation to cover these cases.

One way to approach this is to use the **exponential function's** Taylor series expansion:

$$a^x = e^{x \ln a} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(x \ln a)^n}{n!}$$

This expansion allows us to compute \`a^x\` for any real \`x\` using an infinite sum of terms. However, in practice, we need a more efficient and accurate method.

**Implementation Details:**

In JavaScript, the \`Math.pow()\` function is implemented using a combination of algorithms and mathematical techniques. Here's a high-level overview of how it's done:

1. **Argument reduction**: The first step is to reduce the exponent \`y\` (in this case, \`Math.PI\`) to a smaller range, which makes the calculation more efficient. This is done using the property \`a^(y + k) = a^y \* a^k\`, where \`k\` is an integer. By subtracting the integer part of \`y\` from \`y\`, we can reduce the exponent to a smaller range, typically between 0 and 1.
2. **Exponential function approximation**: The reduced exponent is then used to approximate the exponential function using a **rational approximation** or a **polynomial approximation**. These approximations are designed to be fast and accurate over a specific range of values.
3. **Lookup tables**: To further improve performance, some implementations use precomputed lookup tables for common values of \`x\` and \`y\`. These tables store precomputed values of \`a^x\` for a range of \`x\` values, which can be quickly looked up and interpolated to obtain the final result.
4. **Arithmetic operations**: The final result is computed using a combination of arithmetic operations, such as multiplication, division, and exponentiation, using the reduced exponent and the approximated exponential function.

In the case of \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\`, the JavaScript interpreter would:

* Reduce the exponent \`Math.PI\` to a smaller range, e.g., \`Math.PI - 3\` (since \`Math.PI\` is approximately 3.14159...).
* Use a rational or polynomial approximation to compute \`x^(Math.PI - 3)\`.
* Use lookup tables or arithmetic operations to compute the final result, \`x^Math.PI\`.

Keep in mind that the actual implementation details may vary depending on the JavaScript engine and the specific implementation of the \`Math.pow()\` function.

I hope this helps you understand how JavaScript interpreters calculate \`Math.pow(x, Math.PI)\` and other non-integer exponents!`,

      input: "what is the furthest a human has been from earth",
      output: [
        `The furthest a human has ever been from Earth is approximately 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth. This record was set by the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970.

Apollo 13 was intended to be the third mission to land humans on the Moon, but an explosion on board the spacecraft forced the crew to abandon their lunar landing plans and instead use their lunar module as a "lifeboat" to return to Earth.

During the course of their journey back to Earth, the Apollo 13 crew traveled further away from the Earth than any other humans in history. The distance they reached was about 47,000 miles (75,600 kilometers) beyond the Moon's orbit.

It's worth noting that the current record for the farthest distance traveled from Earth by a human-made object is held by the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which was launched in 1977 and is now in interstellar space. However, Voyager 1 is not a manned spacecraft, so it does not hold the record for the farthest a human has been from Earth.`,
        `The furthest a human has ever been from Earth is approximately 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers), which was achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970. This distance was reached when the spacecraft swung around the far side of the Moon and began its journey back to Earth.

However, it's important to note that this is not the farthest humans have been from our home planet in terms of absolute distance. The Voyager 1 spacecraft, for example, has traveled much further away from Earth than any human ever has or likely will in the foreseeable future. As of now, Voyager 1 is over 14 billion miles (22 billion kilometers) away from Earth and continues to travel through interstellar space.`,
        `The farthest human from Earth is likely to be the astronauts who flew to the Moon during the Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The farthest distance from Earth reached by a human is approximately 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers), which was achieved by the Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, when they landed on the Moon's surface on July 20, 1969.

However, it's worth noting that the farthest human-made object from Earth is the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which is currently about 14.2 billion miles (22.8 billion kilometers) away from Earth, or about 125 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun. Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977, and has been traveling through interstellar space since August 2012.

Here's a breakdown of the farthest distances reached by humans and spacecraft:

* Farthest human from Earth: Apollo 11 astronauts (Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin) - approximately 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) from Earth
* Farthest spacecraft from Earth: Voyager 1 - approximately 14.2 billion miles (22.8 billion kilometers) from Earth, or about 125 AU from the Sun

It's worth noting that there are ongoing efforts to send humans to Mars and beyond in the coming decades, which could potentially break these records. For example, NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The ultimate goal is to use the Moon as a stepping stone for a manned mission to Mars, which could potentially reach distances of up to 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) from Earth.`,
        `The farthest a human has been from Earth is approximately 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) away, achieved by the Apollo 11 astronauts during their mission to the Moon in July 1969.

On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, and Michael Collins embarked on the historic Apollo 11 mission, which included the first lunar landing. As part of their journey, they traveled to the Moon and back, reaching a maximum distance from Earth of about 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) on July 21, 1969.

To put this in perspective, the average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). So, the Apollo 11 astronauts were about 9,800 miles (15,770 kilometers) farther away from Earth than the Moon's average distance.

It's worth noting that while this is the farthest a human has been from Earth, there have been several spacecraft that have traveled much farther away from our planet. For example, Voyager 1, launched in 1977, has traveled over 14 billion miles (22.5 billion kilometers) from Earth, or about 125 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun. However, these spacecraft were unmanned, and no human has traveled farther than the Apollo 11 astronauts.`,

<BlogHeader {bg} title="Llama 3 fails some basic tests" />
<p>
  The much-hyped Llama 3 came out recently (as of writing). It ranks high on standardized
  benchmarks, and LMSYS (English) says the 70B is on the same tier as GPT-4! And it's pretty good at
  songwriting.
</p>
<p>
  However, I mainly use LLMs for answering my (and other people's) random questions. For this
  purpose, Llama 3 is surprisingly bad. Its answers often don't include the correct answer, or bury
  it in a lot of text.
</p>
<p>
  I've collected a number of questions where Llama doesn't do well in. I'll show these by comparing
  the responses from 2 Mixtrals and 2 Llamas. Of course, this only includes ones where Llama does
  worse, but those are the majority (especially excluding writing-based tasks).
