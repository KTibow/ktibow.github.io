<ul>
  <li>
    <p>AI that processes information on the scale of time</p>
    <p>
      Similar to what we saw in the Gemini demo, I predict that there's going to be some sort of AI
      that instead of being initiated can process information over time and understand when to jump
      in. This means chatbots that feel more real. For example you could have a bot in a Discord
      server that jumps in whenever someone uses a logical fallacy, while understanding all the
      context.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AI that can iterate on its response</p>
    <p>
      GPT-4 is so good because it has so many internal layers. But if AI could think step by step,
      think about multiple options, think if its code would actually work, and then change its
      response, that might reduce the number of layers required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another GPT version</p>
    <p>
      Past GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo, there's probably going to be a GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 in 2024, given the
      speed of things.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm excited for what 2024 will bring.</p>
