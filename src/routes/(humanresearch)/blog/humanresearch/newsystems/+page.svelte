    Self description: New Systems is an experimental project aimed at improving Toronto's systems
    related to creativity, innovation, and culture. The project seeks to form a fundamental
    understanding of needs, then addresses these needs by creating new systems, communities, and
    infrastructure. Learnings and insights from the project are shared broadly to benefit the wider
    community.
