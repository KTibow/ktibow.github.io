  It's complicated. Lately, I've been listening to a lot of complextro music, and it's become quite common to see every artist being associated with Geoxor simply because he's popular. However, SVRGE is my favorite complextro artist, and when I'm listening to his music, Geoxor doesn't even cross my mind.

I see a lot of people talking about “rip off of geoxor”. So do you think chocolate ice cream is a rip off of vanilla? Kawaī step/ animestep is the ice cream, Kanro and geoxor are the flavors. And I got to say Kanro is tasting pretty good. The past couple of albums have been complete bangers and I love a lot of the older stuff like blossom. Love your work

  @Rakyyy  the think is there’s nothing wrong with getting inspiration from other creators. Whether Kanro did so or just by his own will, he shouldn’t be stopped because there’s already a creator for that genre. I love geoxor but some are just not as good as the others like the latest Killa song, its good but not outstanding. Hellfire really hit me in the right spot

@Silails

Ouch, I hate it when it turns out that amazing artists are just sad and sour individuals. You can't deny it sounds similar when it's easy to see that it is very similar.

Your track being similar to another one isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Maybe you thought of this melody yourself and it just so happens that it sounds similar to another track. This can happen to everyone; it already has happened and will always end up happening. Maybe you listened to it years ago, forgot about it, but it came back to you one day, and you thought it was original and made a track with it. What is important is that you took that melody, put your own sauce on it, and it's fire. But what's bad is that you're here being a prick about it.

I can only guess what it feels like to be compared to someone like Geoxor (even though I don't remember the allegations being fully proven to be true), but you need to be better than those types of people. (SVRGE is the goat, by the way.)

I love your work, and I'd love to like you as a person too.

Lol I have a Playlist just full of music from xplosn, kanro, and geoxor. You guys are all amazing. To those who say they copy each other, they dont. Ye it's kind of the same on the surface bur I love how they all have found ways to make it with noticeable differences between the artists. You guys are amazing :D
(I have no idea what beef geoxor and kanro have but both of their music is awesome. You can't really copy someone else's music unless its the exact same song lyrics and all. It can only sound similar. Stop hating on peeps. It doesn't accomplish anything and it's a waste of all those who are party to its time. You are on this earth a very limited time. Do things you love to think about it. Do what you want to do with the time you have before it's gone.)

ok i was on ur side at first with the whole situation about there being copystrikes on your remixes but man... i can tell the art took lots of effort but you can't deny the whole night city aesthetic is similar to ephemeral. the song is really good, i'll give you that, but everything just whispers the word geoxor to me.
your logos and the way they're stylized (>•< vs ‘•‚ + the written one being in a similar blocky font) and some album artworks. i know that nobody really "owns" the genre, but the way you're executing it really says alot.
you're young and so am i, you can find yourself. i know it's tough having your fav artist clown on you but at this point i think you've gone a tad bit far with the inspiration. take this with a grain of salt as i'm watching this whole shabang go down from the outside but, here's my take on the situation:
geoxor was making a big deal out of it at first, but as time progressed his points became more valid.

I hate that I have to agree with the majority of comments on this video, even if the animation had effort put into it, all that effort went into it looking way too similar to Geoxors pixel anim for his track Ephemeral. And the fact you are denying that the anim is not a copy and not taking the criticism in these comments is sad. Not the Kanro I used to know and not the Kanro I want to be around. However I will leave a analysis on the track and the anim so people can better understand if this is a copy or not.
0:00 - 0:30 | Intros are similar, consisting of a reese bass and little extra plucks in the background. Only difference on Kanros - Eternal is that the intro has vocal chops
0:30 - 1:00 | Lead that has a bit of attack to it (In this case we will call it a sweep lead) sounds similar to the lead in the drop of Geoxor’s track Ephemeral. Snare in Kanro’s track Eternal is very similar to the snare in Ephemeral, having a tonal sound. (Possible inspirations: Knocking sound from Ephemeral, Snare from Ephemeral)
1:20 - 2:10 | I will hand it to Kanro for actually being inspired in this section instead of actually directly copying it. Inspiration was taken from what seems like 1:58 - 2:23 in Ephemeral. However there is no direct copying here.
Rest of Track: Overall somewhat unique but inspired by Geoxor in some ways. Maybe switching the sound design to maybe not appear as a direct copy would help in Kanros case (and changing drums cough the snare)
Animation: This is way too similar to Geoxor’s Ephemeral similarities consisting of the following: Woman, artist name appearing on building, artist logo appearing on building, random icon of some sort on building, city landscape, lights turn off and on and end and beginning of gif, japanese lettering on building
Naming of track: Ephemeral and Eternal sound similar both having an E at the beginning and an AL at the end. (This may be way too in depth and an excuse for trying to find a reason to call him out however I wont list this as a direct copy)
Overall, just a criticism of this track and its obvious similarities. I can understand being inspired by Geoxor in many ways but with Kanros history of blatantly copying Geos track, melodies, arrangements, etc. but this track shares way too many similarities.

  People, don't you see this is VERY similar to Ephemeral? I DON'T THINK GEOXOR OWN HIS GENRE, I'm not an idiot. But Kanro stealed from Geoxor before, and stealing now.
  What he stealed here, is the idea of the gif. It is very similar to Ephemeral. Too similar.
  Or remember his album Dimension. Too similar to Geoxor's Neon Eyes, doesn't it?
  Oh, and the logo of Kanro, no, of course he didn't steal it from Geoxor.
  And about stealed music: Kanro - Sakura is ALL Geoxor's Nana. It can't be called Kanro's music, it's just a remix of Nana.

Hello. Listen.. I started following your work not so long ago, and I like your music. But.. I think you really need to think about the greater originality of your work.. I know you have conflicts with Geoxor. Maybe I don't fully understand the whole situation (because I don't know English well), but it seems to me that he and his supporters are putting too much pressure on you. I understand that you are in a serious condition because of all this. Many performers were inspired by someone else - this is normal, but you shouldn't get so carried away with it.. Sorry, but your Geoxor inspiration is too obvious. You need to find the real you, I'm sure you're capable of more original work. Understand, this is necessary for your safety. I don't want it to end any worse than it is now. I am sure that you are a good person, and I really hope that everything will be fine with you

  As a Geoxor fan (if that even matters), I think this music is plenty original. While vocal chops are used in similar genres, the composition and vibe of the songs feel unique to me.
  This is a matter of OPINION though, yours and mine.
  Also, saftey? Who stands to be hurt by art?

  @funcat3560  As I said, Geoxor puts pressure on Kanro. Speaking of security, I mean first of all, how would it not come to a serious cancell culture. And sometimes real threats come after that, but I think it's unlikely to come to that

  @lehathebalbes  I can't (and hope not to) find any instance of Goexor accusing Kanro. But I hope Kanro gets to keep making music like this, as I feel it is unique.
  That being said others should let Geo handle this situation, not make accusations themselves. I get how cancle culture and threats are dangerous, my bad.

  @dynamo_star  I know. I'm not talking about genre, but rather primary about the visuar presentation. Although Kanro's vocal chops with some samples and sometimes even melodies are too reminiscent of Geoxor

  People, don't you see this is VERY similar to Ephemeral? I DON'T THINK GEOXOR OWN HIS GENRE, I'm not an idiot. But Kanro stealed from Geoxor before, and stealing now.
  What he stealed here, is the idea of the gif. It is very similar to Ephemeral. Too similar.
  Or remember his album Dimension. Too similar to Geoxor's Neon Eyes, doesn't it?
  Oh, and the logo of Kanro, no, of course he didn't steal it from Geoxor.
  And about stealed music: Kanro - Sakura is ALL Geoxor's Nana. It can't be called Kanro's music, it's just a remix of Nana.

## Kanro - Sakura

### Description
Since today is Valentines day, here's a song for the lovebirds!
(P.S. this song was never an inspiration from Nana at all, the melodic in the start was a huge coincidence and I never expected it myself. I would like to still give credit to geoxor though ‪@Geoxor‬ )

Playing this song at the same time as Geoxor's Nana makes it sound like one individual song
They are so similar I can't even differentiate the two songs
Both songs are in the same key, have similar melodies, progress the same way, and use similar instruments.
They even end in the same way.

  There's like no difference between them

  @kanromusic

  @destiny4963  there's a huge difference. If you understood music theory, Keys are a thing. Both this song and Nana are in Key signature D#min . They're both also in the same BPM 128 because that's the default tempo lock for House music.
  please stop assuming that I have "copied" or "plagaraised" Nana, there's many songs with similar melodies, I personally wouldn't mind or care.
