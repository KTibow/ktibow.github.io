  This post is a little different: while Human Research is always infodumps, for this post I
  collected its in a <a
    href="https://github.com/KTibow/ktibow.github.io/tree/main/src/routes/(humanresearch)/blog/humanresearch/geoxorkanro"
    >rawer format</a
  >, and the rest will be Gemini 3's analysis of the infodump. Sorry if you were expecting something
  more... but, on the other hand, you shouldn't have high standards for Human Research.

  The conflict between Greek producer <strong>Geoxor</strong> and British producer
  <strong>Kanro</strong> is a case study in artistic influence, community tribalism, and the volatile
  nature of online reputation. What began as a clear case of a young fan emulating their idol has mutated
  into a years-long feud characterized by allegations of plagiarism, racism, and harassment, fueled by
  two distinct echo chambers that refuse to coexist.
</p>

<h2>1. The Origin: &ldquo;Inspiration&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Theft&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
  The core of the conflict lies in the undeniable sonic and aesthetic similarities between the two
  artists.
</p>

<h3>The &ldquo;Geoxor Clone&rdquo; Era (2020&ndash;2022)</h3>

<p>
  Kanro admits openly that he discovered Geoxor in 2020 and was &ldquo;fully inspired&rdquo; by him.
  However, the data suggests this went beyond inspiration into direct emulation.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Branding:</strong> Kanro&rsquo;s early logo (<code>&lsquo;&bull;&sbquo;</code>) was a
    stylistic mirror of Geoxor&rsquo;s (<code>❱•❰</code>). His font choices and &ldquo;anime girl in
    a neon city&rdquo; album art aesthetic were nearly identical to Geoxor's branding.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Discography Mirroring:</strong> The tracklists reveal a pattern of Kanro releasing songs
    with titles identical or thematically adjacent to Geoxor&rsquo;s, often shortly after the
    original:
    <ul>
      <li>Geoxor: <em>Euphoria</em> (6y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Euphoria</em> (3y ago)</li>
      <li>Geoxor: <em>Moonlight</em> (6y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Moonlight</em> (1y ago)</li>
      <li>Geoxor: <em>Sakura</em> (5y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Sakura</em> (3y ago)</li>
      <li>Geoxor: <em>Virtual</em> vs. Kanro: <em>New World</em> (Virtual style)</li>
      <li>
        Geoxor: <em>Ephemeral</em> vs. Kanro: <em>Eternal</em> (Similar phonetics, similar pixel art
        music videos).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Musical Composition:</strong> Community analysis points to specific tracks where
    melodies appear lifted. For example, Kanro&rsquo;s <em>You&rsquo;re Cute</em> is widely accused
    of being a reskin of Geoxor&rsquo;s <em>Heal Her</em>, and <em>Salem</em> is compared heavily to
    Geoxor &amp; SVRGE&rsquo;s <em>DEAD</em>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Geoxor&rsquo;s Perspective:</strong> To Geoxor and his community, Kanro is not a peer but a
  &ldquo;parasite&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;Walmart version&rdquo; who built a career by strip-mining Geoxor&rsquo;s
  sound design and visual identity. Geoxor views Kanro&rsquo;s output not as flattery, but as intellectual
  property theft.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Kanro&rsquo;s Perspective:</strong> Kanro views this as a &ldquo;practice of inspiration.&rdquo;
  He acknowledges the early similarities but argues that he has evolved. He views the constant comparisons
  as harassment, arguing that Geoxor does not &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Kawaii/Animestep genre or the pixel
  art aesthetic.
</p>

<h2>2. The Turning Point: The 2022 Allegations</h2>

<p>
  The dynamic shifted drastically in September 2022. Allegations surfaced accusing Geoxor of
  predatory behavior toward minors, racism, and homophobia (the &ldquo;Bonn tweet&rdquo; and
  subsequent fallout).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Weaponization of Morality:</strong> Kanro utilized these allegations to seize the moral
    high ground. By framing Geoxor as a &ldquo;pedophile,&rdquo; &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;groomer,&rdquo;
    Kanro attempts to invalidate Geoxor&rsquo;s criticisms of his music. In Kanro&rsquo;s server, banning
    users for &ldquo;glazing&rdquo; (praising) Geoxor is common, and the allegations are treated as absolute
    fact.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Geoxor&rsquo;s Defense:</strong> Geoxor denied the grooming allegations, framing them as
    a smear campaign involving fabricated or decontextualized screenshots. His community largely accepted
    this defense, viewing the allegations as &ldquo;cancel culture&rdquo; gone wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The &ldquo;Racism&rdquo; Dispute:</strong> Kanro claims Geoxor is racist, citing a
    leaked DM where Geoxor allegedly dismisses Kanro by saying,
    <em>&ldquo;Besides he is black.&rdquo;</em> Geoxor&rsquo;s camp has not publicly addressed this specific
    screenshot in the provided logs, but they generally dismiss Kanro as a &ldquo;pathological liar.&rdquo;
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. The War of the Servers (Tribalism)</h2>

<p>
  The conflict is sustained not by the artists alone, but by their Discord communities, which
  function as opposing realities.
</p>

<h3>Team Geoxor (The &ldquo;Originals&rdquo;)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Culture:</strong> Elitist and protective. They view Geoxor as the pioneer of the genre.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>View on Kanro:</strong> They refer to him with derogatory nicknames (&ldquo;Cumro,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Wankro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Walmart Geoxor&rdquo;). They actively monitor Kanro&rsquo;s releases
    to spot &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; assets or melodies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The &ldquo;Victim&rdquo; Narrative:</strong> They believe Kanro fabricates drama for attention
    (e.g., the incident where Kanro claimed Geoxor took down his album art, which turned out to be a
    copyright claim from the artist Mekaiime for tracing). They view Kanro as a &ldquo;pathological liar&rdquo;
    who uses the 2022 allegations as a shield for his lack of originality.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Team Kanro (The &ldquo;Protagonists&rdquo;)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Culture:</strong> Defensive and morally righteous. They view Kanro as an underdog bullying
    victim.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>View on Geoxor:</strong> They define Geoxor entirely by the 2022 allegations. To them, Geoxor
    is a predator, and therefore his music is invalid.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The &ldquo;Growth&rdquo; Narrative:</strong> They insist Kanro has moved past his &ldquo;copycat&rdquo;
    phase and is now a legitimate artist being unfairly targeted by a jealous, older artist. They validate
    Kanro&rsquo;s anger, reinforcing his belief that Geoxor is &ldquo;obsessed&rdquo; with him.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Psychological Dynamics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Geoxor&rsquo;s Ego vs. Insecurity:</strong> Geoxor publicly claims he &ldquo;doesn't care&rdquo;
    and that Kanro is &ldquo;beneath him,&rdquo; yet he frequently engages in mocking Kanro in his private
    server. This suggests a level of irritation that a &ldquo;copycat&rdquo; is gaining traction using
    his formula.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Kanro&rsquo;s Identity Crisis:</strong> Kanro oscillates between admitting influence (&ldquo;I
    was fully inspired&rdquo;) and aggressive denial (&ldquo;Stop calling me Geoxor&rdquo;). He seeks
    validation from the very person he claims to hate. His community posts often preemptively attack
    Geoxor, suggesting a fixation on his former idol.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The &ldquo;V3&rdquo; Phenomenon:</strong> The logs mention other artists like
    <strong>Dakku</strong>
    and <strong>SVRGE</strong> being labeled &ldquo;Kanro V3&rdquo; or &ldquo;Geoxor copies.&rdquo; This
    indicates a saturation of the &ldquo;Animestep&rdquo; genre, where the lines between style and plagiarism
    are increasingly blurred, making the Geoxor/Kanro feud the flashpoint for a broader debate about
    originality in the scene.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Kanro-Geoxor beef is a stalemate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Musically:</strong> Kanro <em>did</em> build his foundation on mimicking Geoxor, a fact his
    discography proves. However, Geoxor does not own the genre, and Kanro&rsquo;s newer work shows attempts
    at divergence.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Morally:</strong> The allegations against Geoxor remain a permanent stain that Kanro weaponizes
    to deflect criticism of his production. Conversely, Geoxor&rsquo;s community uses Kanro&rsquo;s history
    of tracing art and copying melodies to dismiss his moral posturing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Neither side will &ldquo;win.&rdquo; Geoxor retains the status of the innovator, while Kanro has
  successfully carved out a fanbase by positioning himself as the &ldquo;morally superior&rdquo;
  alternative to Geoxor, despite the derivative nature of his art. The feud has become a symbiotic
  relationship: Geoxor gets a villain to mock to bond his community, and Kanro gets a nemesis to
  fuel his underdog narrative.
