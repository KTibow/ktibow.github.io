<h2>Action item</h2>
<p>Given the broad consensus, suggesting we fast-track the development of these two.</p>
<h3>iRegret Simulator</h3>
<p><strong>Insight</strong></p>
<p>
  Nobody likes regret, yet it's a feeling many encounter frequently. With iRegret Simulator, users
  could avoid the pesky feeling by testing out popular regret-inducing decisions - like getting
  bangs or a new tattoo - before making them in real life.
</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>
  An Apple Intelligence-assisted, front-facing camera would allow users to take a selfie and
  experiment with different hairstyles or colors.
</p>
<p>
  A tattoo simulator mode would let users experiment with a wide range of tattoo placements and
  designs.
</p>
<p>
  Easy sharing options would enable secure distribution of iRegret images with trusted contacts for
  feedback and advice. Polling would provide tangible analytics to help users make educated
  decisions.
</p>
<h3>NapTime</h3>
<p>New FaceTime features for the people who fall asleep on FaceTime calls</p>
<p>
  NapTime would check in on the user's sleeping baby or child through a video call. Other options
  would include the ability for a user to leave an automatic video message of themselves napping
  when they don't answer a FaceTime call.
</p>
<h2>Culinary Integration: Colander</h2>
<p>A calendar for cooks</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>
  This product would be a new version of Calendar that caters to anyone who loves to cook. Users
  could share menus, recipes, or grocery lists and schedule meals for the week. They could also set
  reminders to avoid forgetting crucial ingredients or steps.
</p>
<h2>⭐Favorite Concepts⭐</h2>
<h3>Find my Inner Child</h3>
<p>A proposed feature to help users reconnect with their childhood self</p>
<p>
  [?] We're working on a therapeutic new feature to help users get back in touch with their
  childhood self. Rooted in Find My and powered by Apple Intelligence, this feature would leverage
  achievements in metapsychical tracking and the latest breakthroughs in reparenting to help
  identify and activate a user's playfulness.
</p>
<h3>Photo Booth Aura Photos</h3>
<p>A celestial proposal to integrate aura photography into macOS</p>
<p>
  Aura Photos would be a new feature on Photo Booth that cosmically personalizes portraits on macOS.
  Using a mood-ring exposure process lighting the subject's aura, Photo Booth would provide users
  with the trippy, kaleidoscopic results they enjoy from traditional, analog aura photographs.
</p>
<h2>✨New✨ Feature Ideas: Conscious Processing</h2>
<p>
  Continue to accelerate memory consolidation and mental reflection features. Focus on feelings
  resolution, imagination engagement, and sleep states. Emphasize new or recent experiences.
</p>
<h3>Dream Journal</h3>
<p>A place for users to track their dreams before they forget them!</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>
  [?] Journal already helps users reflect on their daily lives, but what about everything that
  happens while they sleep? It's easy to forget dreams after waking, but with Dream Journal, users
  would be able to log the curious and sometimes confusing things that individuals experience at
  night. They could capture and document the details of the most mundane to mystifying of dreams
  with photos, videos, audio recordings, and hand-drawn illustrations. This could benefit from
  real-time analysis with features that offer insights about the potential meanings of each dream.
</p>
<p><strong>Fresh Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illustrating Dreams</strong></p>
<p>
  [?] Users could illustrate Dream Journal entries with a custom sketch tool. They could turn their
  sketches into a dream in a matter of seconds.
</p>
<p><strong>Soundtracking Dreams</strong></p>
<p>
  [?] If a melody would better capture a user's dream, they could tap the Music option and get
  custom song links to help bring their dreams to life.
</p>
<h3>Intergalactic Clipboard</h3>
<p>The Universal Clipboard is ready to expand beyond the universe into the galaxy.</p>
<p>
  With Intergalactic Clipboard, users could copy and paste anything they see, hear, smell, taste, or
  touch from one Apple device to another.
</p>
<p>
  Integration with Camera, Voice Memos, and Touch ID would make this multisensory, interstellar
  experience possible.
</p>
<p>
  Best of all, Intergalactic Clipboard would be available at any altitude and on any spiritual
  plane.
</p>
<h3>Emotional Time Machine</h3>
<p>
  Time Machine keeps users covered with their most important files. Why not help them back up and
  restore their emotions, too?
</p>
<p>
  Users could connect external storage to their devices and back up memes, Voice Memos, and Journal
  entries. Emotional Time Machine would use Apple Intelligence to organize these files by time of
  year and mood.
</p>
<h2>Experiential Exchange</h2>
<h3>Picture in Picture in Picture</h3>
<p>
  How many users really open only two tabs at once? It's time to pump up the productivity with this
  proposed feature update, Picture in Picture in Picture, which would allow video or FaceTime use
  with multiple other apps or Safari windows. The window curation feature would allow windows to
  scale down, moving them to any corner of the screen as needed.
</p>
<h3>Scratch-and-Sniff Stickers</h3>
<p>A proposal to make Messages more sensory and immersive</p>
<p>
  Scratch-and-Sniff Stickers would evoke emotion, memory, and excitement thanks to new features that
  would help users link fragrances with their favorites emoji.
</p>
<p>*Would be good to have another discussion about sensory and observational resonance.</p>
<h3>iCloud Public...</h3>
<p>...</p>
<h3>Haptic Vibe Checks</h3>
<p>A proposal for the "On...</p>

<p>And last, but certainly not least...</p>
<h2>Live Pet Translation</h2>
<p>Speak raccoon, live the adventure.</p>
<p>
  We're bringing Live Pet Translation to the Translate app, beginning with support for the animal we
  all most yearn to understand: raccoons.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you're seeking a deeper sense of connection to the raccoons you adopted after a basement
  invasion, or you just want to know what's running through the minds of the chaos critters digging
  through your garbage bins, Live Pet Translation with raccoon support will open the door to mutual
  understanding - or at least a little mutual mischief.
</p>
<p>
  Translate has changed the way people communicate by quickly and easily translating text, images,
  and live conversations. Now it's time to bridge the gap across species. The next time a raccoon
  looks at you demanding to know why their cotton candy disappears in water, or whether the
  drive-thru will be serving curly fries tonight, you'll be ready - with Translate.
</p>
