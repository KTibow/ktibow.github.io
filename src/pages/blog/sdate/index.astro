    Eternal September Mode
  </label>

  <p>
    This post is a Human Research-type post - it answers a question the internet can't answer - but
    it's interesting enough I figured I'd blog about it. The question is how old sdate, the famous
    program that would say that today is still Eternal September (September {dayOfSeptember}, 1993),
    is.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might try going to GitHub and finding the
    <a href="https://github.com/df7cb/sdate/commit/175a4c17cbf9a01dd5df3f3a8cf91f6caca9ff26"
      >oldest commit</a
    >
    first. It's from <time {...eternalSeptember("2004-10-16")}>October 16, 2004</time>... but it
    says "[svn-inject] Installing original source of sdate" so it clearly existed before then.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might also try looking through the sources for a copyright notice. Turns out it's all &copy;
    1993. Unhelpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, we have to start looking for other sources. I got Claude Code to do some
    research, and it found:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Sdate is based on fakeroot, created in <time {...eternalSeptember("1997")}>1997</time
        ></strong
      >. Its code has copyright notices to
      <time {...eternalSeptember("1997")}>1997</time>, and there were
      <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1997/09/msg00163.html">discussions about it</a>
      on <time {...eternalSeptember("1997-09-06")}>September 6, 1997</time>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sdate is created by Christoph Berg</strong>. He's
      <a href="https://www.df7cb.de/df7cb/">explained his timeline</a>, from which we can infer that
      he was born ~<time {...eternalSeptember("1977")}>1977</time>, got the callsign DG8VD in <time
        {...eternalSeptember("1994-12")}>December 1994</time
      >, and got the callsign DF7CB in <time {...eternalSeptember("1995-10")}>October 1995</time>.
      He would be just ~16 during Eternal September.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But that's all evidence that it had to be created past <time {...eternalSeptember("1997")}
      >1997</time
    >. That doesn't stop it from being created ~<time {...eternalSeptember("2004-10")}
      >October 2004</time
    > though. What if the original date was still correct? It turns out that if you keep looking, the
    evidence actually says so. The apt changelog shows release 0.1 as from
    <time {...eternalSeptember("2004-10-15")}>October 15, 2004</time>, and if you go to <code
      >debian/copyright</code
    >, it notes the first package was built on the same day (although written as September 4063,
    1993).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we haven't found when development started, so I'm not comfortable with saying "sdate started
    on this date". Actually - I take that back. I know when sdate started. A day in September 1993.
