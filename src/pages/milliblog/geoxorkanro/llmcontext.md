geoxor branding: he has a logo that looks like ❱•❰ but it's rarely used in favor of the wordmark these days (although it's still used in the discord)

kanro branding: he originally had a logo that looked like ‘•‚ and a wordmark that used a font similar to geoxor's, but they were first replaced by a logo that looks like a diamond with a crownlike shape at the top, and then by specific characters (depending on the context)
