dave 2 quiere banear a Kanro porq supuestamente estaba seduciendo a un chibolo de 11 años por chat
y porq se cargó el server o algo así
pero me parece raro q después de eso no haya insistido
o sea dice todo eso y después está como si las huevas

https://i.imgur.com/Hwh22kc.png (transcription: Kanro 50 minutes ago

the album was removed the next day after it's release because geoxor contacted mekailme about the cover art. I had no other choice.

Nowadays, I don't know what the hell I'm even doing anymore, I've just been searching far and wide for an artist to make or let me use their art for my music, nobody is interested.

Instead of trying to find out what I gotta do with myself, I'm instead playing games on my own 24/7. I hate it, It feels like I don't even have a hobby anymore, everything is a mess.
