    This post is a little different: while Human Research is always infodumps, for this post I
    collected its in a <a
      href="https://github.com/KTibow/ktibow.github.io/tree/main/src/pages/milliblog/geoxorkanro"
      >rawer format</a
    >, and the rest will be Gemini 3's analysis of the infodump. Sorry if you were expecting
    something more... but, on the other hand, you shouldn't have high standards for Human Research.

    The conflict between Greek producer <strong>Geoxor</strong> and British producer
    <strong>Kanro</strong> is a case study in artistic influence, community tribalism, and the volatile
    nature of online reputation. What began as a clear case of a young fan emulating their idol has mutated
    into a years-long feud characterized by allegations of plagiarism, racism, and harassment, fueled
    by two distinct echo chambers that refuse to coexist.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Origin: “Inspiration” vs. “Theft”</h2>

  <p>
    The core of the conflict lies in the undeniable sonic and aesthetic similarities between the two
    artists.
  </p>

  <h3>The “Geoxor Clone” Era (2020–2022)</h3>

  <p>
    Kanro admits openly that he discovered Geoxor in 2020 and was “fully inspired” by him. However,
    the data suggests this went beyond inspiration into direct emulation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Branding:</strong> Kanro’s early logo (<code>‘•‚</code>) was a stylistic mirror of
      Geoxor’s (<code>❱•❰</code>). His font choices and “anime girl in a neon city” album art
      aesthetic were nearly identical to Geoxor's branding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discography Mirroring:</strong> The tracklists reveal a pattern of Kanro releasing songs
      with titles identical or thematically adjacent to Geoxor’s, often shortly after the original:
      <ul>
        <li>Geoxor: <em>Euphoria</em> (6y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Euphoria</em> (3y ago)</li>
        <li>Geoxor: <em>Moonlight</em> (6y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Moonlight</em> (1y ago)</li>
        <li>Geoxor: <em>Sakura</em> (5y ago) vs. Kanro: <em>Sakura</em> (3y ago)</li>
        <li>Geoxor: <em>Virtual</em> vs. Kanro: <em>New World</em> (Virtual style)</li>
        <li>
          Geoxor: <em>Ephemeral</em> vs. Kanro: <em>Eternal</em> (Similar phonetics, similar pixel art
          music videos).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Musical Composition:</strong> Community analysis points to specific tracks where melodies
      appear lifted. For example, Kanro’s <em>You’re Cute</em> is widely accused of being a reskin of
      Geoxor’s <em>Heal Her</em>, and <em>Salem</em> is compared heavily to Geoxor & SVRGE’s <em
        >DEAD</em
      >.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Geoxor’s Perspective:</strong> To Geoxor and his community, Kanro is not a peer but a “parasite”—a
    “Walmart version” who built a career by strip-mining Geoxor’s sound design and visual identity. Geoxor
    views Kanro’s output not as flattery, but as intellectual property theft.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Kanro’s Perspective:</strong> Kanro views this as a “practice of inspiration.” He acknowledges
    the early similarities but argues that he has evolved. He views the constant comparisons as harassment,
    arguing that Geoxor does not “own” the Kawaii/Animestep genre or the pixel art aesthetic.
  </p>

  <h2>2. The Turning Point: The 2022 Allegations</h2>

  <p>
    The dynamic shifted drastically in September 2022. Allegations surfaced accusing Geoxor of
    predatory behavior toward minors, racism, and homophobia (the “Bonn tweet” and subsequent
    fallout).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Weaponization of Morality:</strong> Kanro utilized these allegations to seize the moral
      high ground. By framing Geoxor as a “pedophile,” “racist,” and “groomer,” Kanro attempts to invalidate
      Geoxor’s criticisms of his music. In Kanro’s server, banning users for “glazing” (praising) Geoxor
      is common, and the allegations are treated as absolute fact.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Geoxor’s Defense:</strong> Geoxor denied the grooming allegations, framing them as a smear
      campaign involving fabricated or decontextualized screenshots. His community largely accepted this
      defense, viewing the allegations as “cancel culture” gone wrong.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The “Racism” Dispute:</strong> Kanro claims Geoxor is racist, citing a leaked DM where Geoxor
      allegedly dismisses Kanro by saying,
      <em>“Besides he is black.”</em> Geoxor’s camp has not publicly addressed this specific screenshot
      in the provided logs, but they generally dismiss Kanro as a “pathological liar.”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. The War of the Servers (Tribalism)</h2>

  <p>
    The conflict is sustained not by the artists alone, but by their Discord communities, which
    function as opposing realities.
  </p>

  <h3>Team Geoxor (The “Originals”)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Culture:</strong> Elitist and protective. They view Geoxor as the pioneer of the genre.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>View on Kanro:</strong> They refer to him with derogatory nicknames (“Cumro,” “Wankro,”
      “Walmart Geoxor”). They actively monitor Kanro’s releases to spot “stolen” assets or melodies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The “Victim” Narrative:</strong> They believe Kanro fabricates drama for attention (e.g.,
      the incident where Kanro claimed Geoxor took down his album art, which turned out to be a copyright
      claim from the artist Mekaiime for tracing). They view Kanro as a “pathological liar” who uses the
      2022 allegations as a shield for his lack of originality.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Team Kanro (The “Protagonists”)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Culture:</strong> Defensive and morally righteous. They view Kanro as an underdog bullying
      victim.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>View on Geoxor:</strong> They define Geoxor entirely by the 2022 allegations. To them, Geoxor
      is a predator, and therefore his music is invalid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The “Growth” Narrative:</strong> They insist Kanro has moved past his “copycat” phase and
      is now a legitimate artist being unfairly targeted by a jealous, older artist. They validate Kanro’s
      anger, reinforcing his belief that Geoxor is “obsessed” with him.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Psychological Dynamics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Geoxor’s Ego vs. Insecurity:</strong> Geoxor publicly claims he “doesn't care” and that
      Kanro is “beneath him,” yet he frequently engages in mocking Kanro in his private server. This suggests
      a level of irritation that a “copycat” is gaining traction using his formula.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kanro’s Identity Crisis:</strong> Kanro oscillates between admitting influence (“I was fully
      inspired”) and aggressive denial (“Stop calling me Geoxor”). He seeks validation from the very person
      he claims to hate. His community posts often preemptively attack Geoxor, suggesting a fixation on
      his former idol.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The “V3” Phenomenon:</strong> The logs mention other artists like <strong
        >Dakku</strong
      >
      and <strong>SVRGE</strong> being labeled “Kanro V3” or “Geoxor copies.” This indicates a saturation
      of the “Animestep” genre, where the lines between style and plagiarism are increasingly blurred,
      making the Geoxor/Kanro feud the flashpoint for a broader debate about originality in the scene.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>The Kanro-Geoxor beef is a stalemate.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Musically:</strong> Kanro <em>did</em> build his foundation on mimicking Geoxor, a fact
      his discography proves. However, Geoxor does not own the genre, and Kanro’s newer work shows attempts
      at divergence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Morally:</strong> The allegations against Geoxor remain a permanent stain that Kanro weaponizes
      to deflect criticism of his production. Conversely, Geoxor’s community uses Kanro’s history of tracing
      art and copying melodies to dismiss his moral posturing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Neither side will “win.” Geoxor retains the status of the innovator, while Kanro has
    successfully carved out a fanbase by positioning himself as the “morally superior” alternative
    to Geoxor, despite the derivative nature of his art. The feud has become a symbiotic
    relationship: Geoxor gets a villain to mock to bond his community, and Kanro gets a nemesis to
    fuel his underdog narrative.
