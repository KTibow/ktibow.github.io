So apparently, any goddamn fucking artist who makes an artwork for one or more track for shitoxor is automatically a permanent trademark for his music.

Why the fuck is everyone saying that I'm "trying so hard to be geoxor"?? Aduare doesn't belong to him, nor do they work exclusively for him, stop taking the piss and do your own research, I stopped listening to geoxor since 2022 barely began bro.

It shouldn't be normalised to compare people with others, especially those with a very bad reputation, it's honestly just disrespectful to one or either party.

similarities occur but they never have to mean that they were intentional. like yeah, he's "geoxor wannabe", sure bro, also when was the last time you went to check your ears???
It's obvious that ELECTRONIC music is SIMILIAR to each one another, just like it is in rock, pop, hyperpop, rap, even fucking riddim, different people never ever heard each other's music create something that sound alike, IT IS NOT THE REASON TO TELL EACH ONE OF THEM "Cool track! Oh, also, your music is just like \any other artist\ !"
You have to realise it hits creator's feeling of his own CREATIVITY, you're just saying that other people just do as well as him, maybe even better. Respect how every artist have their own unique thing, the catch, that makes you go back again and again and in every single track you hear that catchy thingy. And you know that you love it.

I believe the intention wasn't quite what you stated here. I speak for myself here by saying I was reminded of his song which had the same cover artist. Now that doesn't mean I believe you're trying to copy or imitate him in any way. On the other hand, I haven't looked into the artist who made the background art but having it be in a cyberpunk ish looking city with a girl leaning over on the side doesn't help it differentiate itself from ephemeral. I might just be overthinking this one but that's my take on it.

More Geoxor drama, fucking great! What absolutely sucks is that I've been doing my absolute hardest to avoid talking about this.

Let's share this community post so everyone knows what I've been experiencing, I have more where this all came from but I have a limit set to how many images I can attach.

This old fart doesn't know when to get his priorities straight. It seems like after all that's happened to him back in September 2022, he has not learnt shit from his mistakes and continues to project ignorancy towards me for absolutely no reason.

I have about 3 things to call this dude out for:

- False claiming
- Racism
- & Avoiding Peace

For the false claiming: I've released an album on my birthday, featuring 9 songs and an Intro. And of course this absolute asshole of an artist IN HIS TWENTIES has to say something about it.

He mentions how i "totally don't rip off everyone's melodies" (obviously in a sarcastic tone). Dude, if you look at the Fucking description of the track then you'd know that there's a whole influence behind it, you don't HAVE to assume EVERY fucking release I make is a "rip off" of a track. It's a work of practice to be inspired and I even came up with my OWN melodies in the same key. Yes, I expected people to notice because I made it obvious.

Secondly, Racism? Grow the fuck up.
It's 2024 bro, know your place and know the environment you're in, you're surrounded by different cultures and people from different parts of the world, and you underlook that and decide to get judgemental about my skin colour? You cannot be serious, right? Absolutely disorienting, and pure degeneracy. BonnDubz also has a negative shadow under this too because he's actually had the full set of screenshots which I lost 2 years ago in a corrupted hard drive - Bonn had all the opportunity to show via his Twitter thread that I'm literally a proven victim of racist remarks from this guy, yet he decided to hide that. Fucked up word we live in

Lastly, Avoiding Peace.
I mean at this point dude, you're just a bad guy, and by bad I mean you're just evil aura. You avoided me whenever I attempt to put shit to an end, you got your manager to C&D (Cease & Desist) me, threatened to sue me?? You treated me so fucking bad in the past 4 years and I've done absolutely no damage to you. You're rocking at ALMOST 300K subscribers right now bro, and I'm down here at 8.70K. I'm 17, recently started college and you're fucking 23, living your life the way you've dreamed of. You're ahead of me, more than anyone else. So what else do you need?? You choose not to be nice to people and you choose not to respect yourself because you grew a huge ego. Sort your shit out.

Your apology was not sincere and the whole internet knew it. Owe up to your shit and I ain't gonna get off of your case until you've fully shown that you're over the whole drama.

You can find my email at kanro@europe.com if you want to talk further on this, or just add me on discord via kanromusic. I DO NOT want to speak to your manager, fuck that.

Good christ man, fix your shit.

Do you know a kanro?

I’ve heard of him on youtube  
well his music and they are the same as mine  
He is a music thief

Are you sure about that? he is just a boy who is inspired by your music and his desire is to be just like you

And I talked to him and he told me that you insulted him why?

Also, one of my old friends from 2021 messaged me again, and I was able to obtain the lost screenshots again, proving your hate for black people.

---

**Image 4:**

And I talked to him and he told me that you insulted him why?  
because he is a thief

Are you sure about that? he is just a boy who is inspired by your music and his desire is to be just like you

Keep trusting strangers remember that you and I see each other every day and not that boy

He made it sound like I’ve been stealing samples or something but all of my work is all original and made from scratch.  
I’m allowed to be inspired. We all are??

Yes I know but he seems very cute  
And will you forgive him?

Forgive him ha how am I going to forgive a thief

Well, it doesn’t matter anymore, just talk to my whole band that boy copies my music

Besides he is black

Like WTF man. c’mon and also I’m gonna call out BonnDubz for cropping the part where I was mentioned too, because people have no idea how common racial discrimination is for me and many black artists in the industry

You see, that’s why I don’t like talking to you because in the end you’re always right :+

I’ve went as far as contacting this dude’s manager, I get sent a Cease & Desist email which is literally nothing because It’s just a way of him trying to intimidate me, I’ve tried getting friends to have him talk shit out with me and all he does is avoid peace.

Seriously why for being black? you know something I am very grateful not to be racist because people like that should not exist, all of you are human beings and we should love each other the same and not hate the black race because they are also our family

Geoxor is a bad influence, and a terrible example of someone who is apparently “sorry”.

And to know the many times I’ve tried to reach out to contact you to end the burning drama, only for you to completely avoid peace and continue to talk shit about me in your server, really shows how you have not matured at all.

You’re 23 for crying out loud. grow up

(my friend badly cropped these so I’m sorry ab that))

This is a truly Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi moment

Bs aside, I'm very disappointed by Geo's behavior. He was my favorite artist ever, one where there wasn't a single song I didn't like or love. I believe people can change for the better, we all make dumb mistakes, but...It's been years and it looks like he didn't learn and/or care at all. If I was a producer and I heard a fan of my music was inspired by it, I'd be glad with a smile of proudness. If he's that much against you, to me he only appears as insecure and as someome who fears you could surpass him. Otherwise he's just highly immature.

I rarely comment but whatever you do don’t stop doing you, some people the world revolves around them and always wants to be the victim. I mean artists especially the most renowned rip parts and sections to add in their music (I know there’s other stuff involved) but all you’re doing is finding inspiration and even then it’s all you. Pick any songs from you two and can tell who’s who. It’s one person and whoever fans and it sucks it’s them but just ignore the hate and thank the support. Haters arnt important and they won’t be there when you grow in your art

Hello Kanro. I didn't know you had any disagreements. As for “stealing” music, this is justified only when entire compositions of another musician are downloaded, otherwise it is at least a remix, or if the track is rewritten from scratch, then as a full composition, which requires significant effort and talent. It's not so easy to even just copy someone else's track. And besides, tracks of the same genre are similar, this is normal. As far as racism goes, that's too much.

Perhaps I just want to believe in the best, and this situation will give a good impetus, divide and unite the audience of each artist, give an incentive to everyone to grow. But still xor acts disgracefully and without respect.

Nevertheless, Kanro, I wish you strength to resolve this situation and creative success. Your success in the media will be your personal victory. 🚀

Honestly, that's all really dissappointing. Kanro, I met you as a music creator from your album "Save My World".
It just popped up in one of those youtube playlists for related songs and creators and it was an absolute banger. Since then, I didn't really check every song but they naturally appeared again and again, so it's common to see them nowadays, and... guess what made me like your style so much? "Oh, he reminds me of Geoxor but... different, more unique!"

I am not even joking, the arts you use in your songs made me recall Geoxor and, even though you have songs with similar tones, I just find yours to be better for my kind of music style compared to his work. I thought you knew Geoxor and you two were friends or something, but it seems like I forgot about Geoxor's past actions.
Reading all of this is really dissappointing, because it reminds of past stuff. I stopped listening to Geoxor due to how ignorant he grew as. Instead of acknowledging other people's work, bro is out here competing with smaller channels. 💀

Jokes aside, I really expect you can deal with those problems so we all can get past this. You don't deserve to read those stupid comments of Geoxor, but respectful ones. As a teenager, and I am one too, those kinds of bullshit shouldn't be stuff for you to deal with. Also, don't worry about your tone, it was completely comprehensible given the situation.
It's all stressing and I'm sorry for all of this, but do keep up with your good work. Props to you, man.
