## Bonn tweet

[Bonn’s Twitter post in a whole document]
Hello I’m Bonndubz, but you can just call me Bonn, I’m a 17 year old producer and
artist from Spain. The purpose of this movement is to unmask the face of Geoxor
who has been misusing his fame with bad intentions towards others, specifically;
minors.
Trigger warnings before-hand: nsfw imagery, pedophilia, harassment, sexual abuse
and sexual harassment. However, much more will be mentioned through the whole
drive that I haven&#39;t mentioned above.
To begin with, I want it to be known that not only Geoxor’s actions will be mentioned,
but also the ones done by several of his friends including close ones whom’s actions
are just as sickening and wrong.
I’m here to bring up Geoxor’s actions regarding the past 1 to 2 years, actions like
asking minors for sexual pictures, then guilt tripping them for speaking up about it
and later proceeding to discredit them and everyone else who comes to their
defense. His server consists of blinded and manipulated fans, and so far, the
channel where Geoxor tried to defend himself, guilt tripping and manipulating
everything about our victim Nilly, was later deleted by Geoxor himself, because he of
course knew that we we’re planning to do this exposing sooner or later, however,
you can still see it on the drive folder, as I took screenshots of it for the future, where
Geoxor excuses his actions and we respond to everything he has to say about it.
To support our allegations, his ex girlfriend, also known as Ariimaw, has provided me
with proof to confirm his pedophilic behavior and how manipulative and controlling he
can be.
Ariimaw was threatened by Geoxor with acts of cyber bullying and harassment by his
fanbase if she ever was to speak about these events.
His behavior towards Ariimaw has been extremely inappropriate as he has been
seen leaving suggestive comments, complimenting and sexualizing specific parts of
her body during the time period when she was still a minor (not to mention, she’s still
17 and Geoxor is 21, it was a huge age gap since the very start when they first
started dating). After their break up, he would use Arii’s sexual/”lewd” pictures to
minors and later proceed to ask them for similar ones. In addition, Geoxor has also
shown to be incredibly sexist, homophobic, transphobic and racist (as shown in the
drive).
One of his exes has admitted to being abused and harassed by Geoxor after they
met up.
After the events of him and Ariimaw breaking up, he started hitting up on another
unsuspecting minor, a 16 year old called Nilly, later he started exchanging nudes
with her.
Geoxor seems to have a track record with harassing minors, considering the fact his
behavior has been repeated, with Arii, with Nilly, with Angle, then with Nyamhk, and
whoever knows who else.

On the 20th of June, NIlly contacted me saying that Angle, a 15yo who interacted
with Geoxor, told her that he would say horrible things to her, again and to remark,
already shown in this drive.
After this, Nilly proceeds to tell me how she also has had very weird and creepy, not
to say horrific interactions with him, providing me with a lot of the evidence available
in the drive.
The information gathered was given to me by people whom I reached out to about
this individual, and some of them I gathered myself, easily looking up on the web
about what people had to say about him.
Please take a thorough look at the whole drive and you can be the judge.
The censored names are all people who were close to Geoxor and realized what he
has been doing was horrible, please DO NOT harass any of them, they don’t have
nor want to be associated with Geoxor anymore. To follow up, me and the victims
made a whole server where they could share all their experiences with Geoxor
including respective screenshots.
In addition I wanna say;
Please don’t pay attention to an individual who goes by the name of &quot;Kanro&quot;
who has been trying to leak this doc to other people with the selfish intention
of getting his childish revenge against Geoxor, instead of doing it for the
victims sake. He is an attention seeker with the motive of burying his wrongdoings by
exposing Geoxor.
Best way to avoid it is not giving him the attention he wants.

PD: I want to say that, yes, I have been and I&#39;m still taking therapy due to all of this,
me and my family are hopeful that this is just something temporal and that will go
away with time, but I have severe PTSD from all of this which i hope i can get rid of
someday.
I will never forget what I had to see inside that drive folder, the impotence and how
hard the imagery was to contemplate, it impacted my life in a way I really didn&#39;t want
to and never expected, I don&#39;t wish anyone to experience anything of what me and
others have.
For all the girls out there, if a famous figure asks you for something you are
UNCOMFORTABLE at most sharing, do not do it, you are in the right to do it, you
are not less than that person just because of your following, you are not in the need
to please whoever just because their following or how famous they are or how good
their music is, LESS IF YOU ARE A MINOR.
If you see or experience something like this, please, we encourage you, SPEAK UP.
It sickens me that people haven&#39;t realized since this guy started dating Ariimaw.
[Second tweet]

#EDMTwitter Hey everyone. It appears that Geoxor has sent his manager after me, who
has been sending messages to me in a very threatening and manipulative aura. They are
most likely trying to get personal information from me, which means they wanna go after
me in a legal suit.

## Geoxor video (Whisper transcription)

To fans and friends, I owe you all an apology. In the last few days, many embarrassing things about my personal life have come to light. I know that a lot of the things that you may have seen are a reasonable enough cause for you to question whether I'm a good person or not and raising doubts in the community. I record this today without the intention of covering up or justifying my wrongdoings I've done. To Ari Neely Angle and everyone else who may have felt like they did, I am truly sorry for my mature behavior and I recognize that my actions were wrong. I've apologized to you personally before but I'm still saddened to see that you had no other way than to bring our personal relations to public light. Nevertheless, I understand the motivations you may have had. We were all young when we chatted and I was completely foolish. I have no explanations or excuses for what led me to act the way I did. I was sorry before, I still am and I will remain unforgivable towards myself. I would like to address the allegations now. First and foremost, I would like to ensure you that I'm in no way, shape or form a pedophile. While it may be easy to assume that due to our conversations and age at the time, I want to highlight the fact that our age difference was the same as you would encounter in any high school or college. I don't seek out minors, nor do I harass underage goals or derive pleasure from such stuff. I don't do such things or condone such actions. All the allegations concluded from my personal messages and Discord server are misguiding and intentionally designed to frame me as a racist, homophobic, transphobic groomer and a pedophile harasser. From the bottom of my heart I sincerely apologize to every single one of you and I hope that this message serves its purpose.

## Original wikitubia wording

On September 9, 2022, Twitter user @Twtbonn started the hashtag '#GeoxorIsOver' after creating a thread falsely accusing Geoxor over acts of pedophilia[1], grooming[2], rape[3], sexual harassment, racism and homophobia. To this thread he attached a link to a Google Drive filled with a varied collection of relevant and irrelevant screenshots. These screenshots were anything from hearsay, biased, manipulative[4][5], real but mis-contextualized, fabricated[6][7][8].

## Current wikitubia wording

As of September 9th, 2022, following the rumors of allegations of predatory behavior towards minors, Geoxor's account on Newgrounds has been permanently removed from the platform by the staff members.

## Random community opinion

My humble opinion about situation with Geoxor

Well, I read a post on Reddit called "GEOXOR GOOGLE DRIVE" and looked at what was on this disk. The disk itself, almost all other documents, in particular, were created by a certain Angle (there were also other users adding photos and screenshots, but they are a minority).

In addition to the fact that there Geoxor was exposed as a very exaggerated "lolihunter", it was reported that he was an abuser, and a homophobe, and a transphobe, and so on: then you can enter all the words that are used on Twitter by those who present themselves as a victim of bullying for some of the current trends.

In Russia, it is a common phenomenon that some users of VKontakte are hacked. On their behalf, they ask for a loan of money, post advertisements in conversations, and also expose people-owners not from the best side, sending all sorts of banal vulgarities like mentioning sexual topics, debauchery and all that. And the messages that were sent by "Geoxor" in the screenshots are TOO similar to what similar "hackers" who hack our VKontakte accounts write.

Real life example: my friend was once hacked like this and the "hacker" corresponded with one girl, the messages contained various vulgarities and were very similar to those presented in the screenshots on the disk in the Reddit post.

But I don't mean to say that Geoxor's accounts were hacked. Instead, some group of people simply forged all these correspondences and gradually uploaded them to this disk (hence the different creation / modification dates for the files). In addition, the behavior of the characters in correspondence looks simulated, and there are a lot of photos with self-harm, "stockings" and other things on the Internet, you can even find those that cannot be found by searching for the picture. In general, such content can be produced for some purpose by yourself, why not...

Undoubtedly, all this can turn out on the other side and the "exposure" will be confirmed by some facts stronger than those that were cited. Therefore, in no case do I take sides, because I understand perfectly well that at least 60% of the information is fake. And for myself I conclude: you need to be more careful with what you are fond of and what you work with, also what problems it can cause.

I am not an advanced GD player, but I am fond of electronic music, and for some time I was a fan of Geoxor, I learned some sound design tricks and tricks from him. Geoxor's tracks are not heavily stylized as GD (unlike Panda Eyes and others) and are well mixed, good selection of instruments and sound synthesis, so (apart from kawaii vocal chops) there is a lot to learn.

So, the style of Geoxor's music and the style of his pictures for tracks, accounts on social networks and music platforms, I would say, is quite suitable for accusing him of racism, pedophilia and even homophobia to some extent (you can ask : why are only girls depicted?), and those who are not indifferent to any discrimination can use this. Therefore, it is highly undesirable to make such bold decisions about styling EVERYTHING under SUCH style. And given that there are already several known cases in which people from the GD community fell under such accusations, I begin to think that all the rigmarole now with Geoxor is the result of the risk of these same accusations, this time on a double scale.

Update: they deleted the post "GEOXOR GOOGLE DRIVE", idk why, but it's not available now
