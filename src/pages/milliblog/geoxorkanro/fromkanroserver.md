I'm curious about how you learned to make music. Origin story perhaps. It's amazing you do all this from such a young age so well.

i used to talk so much shit about my mum but that was just my ignorance, I'm grateful she's there for me and to encourage me to be better and to ignore what's bringing me down and focus on what I should do to heal
it's quite a long story
but
this goes all the way back to October 2016

I loved that song but it sucks that it's gone now and replaced with the right version

I started using Incredibox, which isn't necessarily a music production software or site, but it really got me into the whole movement of what else i should discover and unravel from the depths of music production.

I then worked for more than one year using soundation, which is something like bandlab or soundtrap, i had fun using the kick loops and synth midi etc

I then started using FL Studio 12 in christmas of 2017, then understood the bare basics of it in January of 2018.

now fast forward into 2019, I learned mixing using EQ and using Reverb FX, but ofc I wasn't completely there yet with everything, you can listen to a track where I put my mixing skills to the test here:

In 2020, I joined Exyl's community and got to know everyone, including the man himself. I've learnt so much and got inspired to make my own stuff, I even got into dubstep even more at the time because everyone has shown me how the underground scene has much more better music than the vast majority of the more popular dubstep artists.

Exyl taught me mixing and that's when I just announced my new "Kanro" alias which was only active on YouTube and Soundcloud.

I then discovered Geoxor on soundcloud and became an immediate fan and started making animestep. I stopped idolising geoxor after he began mistreating me on social media and discord at most, calling me a copycat and plagarist.

I then distributed my first ever album to spotify on october, then I learned how to promote my music, started getting earnings from Soundcloud, got on dubstepgutter once, became friends with so many big artists, made collaborations with so many people who inspired me including God's Warrior and Akucum, i mean it just got better from there.

I'd say my peakest times were 2021 and 2023. but I'm interested to see what happens for next year
