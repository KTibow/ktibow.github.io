    <h2>SkyClient arc</h2>
    <p>
      <SkyblockTag />
      <a href="https://skyclient.co/">SkyClient</a>, even if a little weird (I wish I found X
      earlier to counterbalance), was a nice place to dump my thoughts and my time into 2022-2024. I
      built 2 bots, an installer (arguably 2 or 3), a website, and a number of edits. I acted with
      too high agency and too low EQ/self consciousness a few times, but overall I'm glad for it.
